 Strangers in a dark room
 Laughing at jokes they didn’t quite hear
 Frosted window panes and cheap champagne
 A face appears
 
 And anything could happen in these cathedrals we roam
 Where shadow people dance
 And trade their glance
 And walk home alone
 
 Staring out the window
 Of the Roosevelt Hotel
 Watching Midtown empty out
 And I kiss her farewell
 
 They say we come from nothing
 And to nothing we’ll return
 And in between is gravity
 And bridges left to burn
