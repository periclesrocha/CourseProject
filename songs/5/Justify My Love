 I want to hold and kiss you in Paris
 I want to hold your hand in Rome
 I want to run naked in a rainstorm
 Make love in a train cross country
 
 You put this in me
 So now what?
 So now what?
 So now what?
 So now what?
 
 I wanna know you
 No, not like that
 I don’t want to be your mother
 I don’t want to be your sister either
 I just wanna be your lover
 I wanna be your baby
 Kiss me, that’s right
 Kiss me, that’s right
 
 I want you to justify my love, my love, my love
 I want you to justify my love
 
 Justify
 
 I want you to justify my love, my love, my love
 I want you to justify my love, my love, my love
 I want you to justify my love, my love, my love
 I want you to justify my love
 
 Poor is the man
 Whose pleasures depend
 On the permission
 Of another
 On the permission
 Permission
 
 I want you to justify my love, my love, my love
 I want you to justify my love, my love, my love
 I want you to justify my love, my love, my love
