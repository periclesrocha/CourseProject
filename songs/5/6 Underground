 Take me down
 6 underground, the ground beneath your feet
 Laid out low
 Not meant to go
 No where or way to meet
 
 I’ve got a head full of drought
 Down here
 So far off from losing out
 Round here
 Overground
 Watch this space
 I’m open to falling from grace
 
 Calm me down
 Bring it round
 Too way high off your street
 I can see
 Like nothing else
 In me you’re better than I wanna be
 
 Don’t think ’cos I understand
 I care
 Don’t think ’cos I’m talking
 We’re friends
 Overground
 Watch this space
 I’m open to falling from grace
 
 Don’t think ’cos I understand
 I care
 Don’t think ’cos I’m talking
 We’re friends
 Overground
 Watch this space
 I’m open to falling from grace
 
 Talk me down
 Safe and sound
 Too strung up to sleep
 Wear me out
 Scream and shout
 Swear my time’s never cheap
 
 I fake my life like I bleed
 Too much
 I’ll take whatever you’re givin’
 Not enough
 Overground
 Watch this space
 I’m open to falling from grace
