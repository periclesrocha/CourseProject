 Love, save us once
 We’ll fall from where we crawled
 Love, save us once
 Beware what you want
 
 Trust us now
 It’s time to let me go
 Give up on us
 Follow what you want
 Trust us now
 It’s time to let me go
 Give up
 Give our soul away
 
 Now you will go
 Save us once
 We’ll never let go
 Where we crawled
 The memories are wrong
 Save us once
 You’ll never wake up
 What you thought you want
 
 Trust us now
 It’s time to let me go
 Give up for now
 Follow what you want
 Trust us now
 It’s time to let me go
 Give up
 Give our soul away
 
 Remember with love
 It’s time to let me never let go
 Follow in your memories alone
 It’s time to let me never let go
 We die alone
