 Ready to go
 
 Ready to go
 
 You’re weird, in tears, too near and too far away
 He said, saw red, went home, stayed in bed all day
 Your t-shirt, dish dirt
 Always love the one you hurt
 
 It’s a crack, I’m back, yeah, I’m standing
 On the rooftop shouting out
 Baby, I’m ready to go
 I’m back and ready to go
 From the rooftop shout it out
 
 It’s a crack, I’m back, yeah, I’m standing
 On the rooftop having it
 Baby, I’m ready to go
 I’m back and ready to go
 From the rooftop shout it out, shout it out
 
 You sleep, too deep, one week is another world
 (Big mouth), big mouth, (drop out), drop out
 You get what you deserve
 You’re strange, insane, one thing you can never change
 
 It’s a crack, I’m back, yeah, I’m standing
 On the rooftop shouting out
 Baby, I’m ready to go
 I’m back and ready to go
 From the rooftop shout it out
 
 It’s a crack, I’m back, yeah, I’m standing
 On the rooftop having it
 Baby, I’m ready to go
 I’m back and ready to go
 From the rooftop shout it out, shout it out
 
 Ready to go
 
 Abused, confused, always love the one that
 Hurt ya, hurt ya, hurt ya, hurt ya
 
 It’s a crack, I’m back, yeah, I’m standing
 On the rooftop shouting out
 Baby, I’m ready to go
 I’m back and ready to go
 From the rooftop shout it out
 
 It’s a crack, I’m back, yeah, I’m standing
 On the rooftop having it
 Baby, I’m ready to go
 I’m back and ready to go
 From the rooftop shout it out
 
 It’s a crack
 
 Baby, I’m ready to go
 
 Baby, I’m ready to go
 
 Baby, I’m ready to go
 
 Baby, I’m ready to go
 
 Baby, I’m ready to go
 
 Baby, I’m ready to go
 Baby, I’m ready to go
 Baby, I’m ready to go
 
 Baby, I’m ready to go
 
 Baby, I’m ready to go
