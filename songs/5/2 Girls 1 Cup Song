 How do you show someone you love
 That they are the one?
 So many ways to express love
 It’s hard to choose just one
 
 How are you gonna do it?
 
 Some people like to kiss, some people like to hug
 Some lesbians like eating each other’s shit out of a cup
 Some people say “I love you”, some even shout it out
 Some people puke semi-digested shit into each other’s mouth
 
 Sometimes making love is not enough
 You have to step it up
 And urinating on her face
 Is not enough to say “I love you”
 
 Some people like to kiss, some people like to hug
 Some lesbians like eating each other’s shit out of a cup
 Some people say “I love you”, some even shout it out
 Some people puke semi-digested shit into each other’s mouth
 
 She’s covered in vomit and human fecies
 That’s how I know that she needs me
 
 She’s covered in vomit and human fecies
 That’s how I know that she needs me
 
 She’s covered in vomit and human fecies
 That’s how I know that she needs me
 
 Shit in my mouth
 And I puke it all over your face
 
 I love you
