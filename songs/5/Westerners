 You said I was
 lost
 ’Cause you found god
 
 Big lips, all lies
 Small hands
 for a simple boy
 
 In this messed up world
 
 Oh it’s time
 I find
 The man in me
 The man in me
 
 You had
 my face
 bound up
 Innersexual
 
 Blond hair
 Blue eyes
 Leather jacket
 In the crowd of Westerners
 
 They got the best of her
 
 Oh it’s time
 I find
 The man in me
 The man in me
 
 Oh it’s time
 I find
 The man in me
 The man in me
 
 I wish, I wish, I wish, I wish
 I was
 
 I wish, I wish, I wish, I wish
 I was
 
 I wish, I wish, I wish, I wish
 I was
 
 I wish, I wish, I wish, I wish
 I was
