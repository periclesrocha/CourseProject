 I don’t want to live like this, Lord
 I don’t want to live at all
 I don’t want to make this face anymore
 But if I don’t, that’s all
 
 I don’t want to live like this anymore
 I don’t want to live at all
 I don’t want to make this face anymore
 But if I don’t, that’s all
 
 I don’t love
 I don’t feel anything
 I don’t feel anything where this love should be
 
 I don’t want to feel this anymore
 But if I don’t, that’s fake
 I don’t want to do this anymore
 But there’s nothing else to take
 
 I don’t love
 I don’t feel anything
 I don’t feel anything where this love should be
 
 I don’t love
 I don’t feel anything
 I don’t feel anything where this love should be
 
 I don’t love
 I don’t feel anything
 I don’t feel anything where this love should be
 
 I don’t love
 I don’t feel anything
 I don’t feel anything where this love should be
 
 I don’t love
 I don’t feel anything
 I don’t feel anything where this love should be
