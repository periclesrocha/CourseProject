 (alright, click me, click me)
 (alright, click me here)
 (alright, click me, click me here)
 (click on me, click me, click me here)
 
 I love my computer
 You make me feel alright
 Every waking hour
 And every lonely night
 
 I love my computer
 For all you give to me
 Predictable errors
 And no identity
 
 And it's never been quite so easy
 I've never been quite so happy
 
 All I need to do is click on you
 And we'll be joined in the most soulless way
 And we'll never ruin each other's day
 'Cause when I'm through I just click and you just go away
 
 (alright, click me, click me here)
 (alright, click me, click me here)
 
 I love my computer
 You're always in the mood
 I get so turned on
 When I turn on you
 
 I love my computer
 You never ask for more
 You can be a princess
 Or you can be my whore
 
 And it's never been quite so easy
 I've never been quite so happy
 
 All I need to do is click on you
 And we'll be joined in the most soulless way
 And we'll never ruin each other's day
 'Cause when I'm through I just click and you just go away
 
 (alright, click me, click me here)
 You just go away
 
 The world outside is so big
 But it's safe in my domain
 'cause to you I'm just a number
 And a clever screen name
 
 All I need to do is click on you
 And we'll be together for eternity
 And no one's ever gonna take my love from me
 'Cause I've got security, her password and a key
 
 (alright, click me, click me here)
 
 Go away (alright, click me, click me here)
 
 Go away (click on me, click me, click me here)
 
 Go away (click on me, alright, click me here)
 
 Go away (click on me, click me, click me here)
 
 Go away (alright, click me, click me here)
 
 Go away (click on me, alright)
 
 Go away
 
 Go away
 
 Go away
