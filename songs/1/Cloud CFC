 The needless slaughter
 Of Homo Sapien
 The relentless assault
 Earth shattering
 Forever lasting
 Survival
 
 You’ve convicted the innocence
 The needless slaughter
 There must be a cure
 Of malice
 For this everlasting disease
 
 I am enraged
 Time to disengage
 In a new revolution
 Earth shattering
 
 Everlasting disease
 
 Do you fear?
 Do you fear?
 
 The needless slaughter
 
 I am enraged
 Time to disengage
 In a new revolution
 
 Do you fear?
 Do you fear?
 
 The needless slaughter
 
 You’ve convicted the innocence
 Time to disengage
 In a new revolution
 
 Do you fear?
 Do you fear?
 
 The needless slaughter
 
 You’ve convicted the innocence
