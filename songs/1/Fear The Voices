 Awww, put our heads together
 Because a signature could change our future
 Uh-huh
 For some wrote you a letter
 Begging you to reconsider
 Yeah
 
 Yeah (yeah-yea)
 
 Put our heads together
 Aaaaah-Aaah-Aaah
 Fear the voices
 You hear today
 If you still have choices
 We’ll blow you away
 
 So they put number on the television Mr. Gardner
 Oh yeah
 A messed up generation put the pressure on you
 You’re a coward
 Uh-huh
 
 Yeah (yea-hey)
 
 A messed up generation
 Aaaaah-Aaah-Aaah
 Fear the voices
 You hear today
 If you still have choices
 We’ll blow you away
 
 We can see right through you, we’re awake
 Send your men and we are all awake
 Awake, awake, awake, awake
 Wake, awake, awake, awake!
 
 Fear the voices
 You hear today
 If you still have choices
 We’ll blow you away
 
 Fear the voices
 Fear the voices
 Fear the voices
 Fear the voices
