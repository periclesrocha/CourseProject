 The fireworks red and green
 I can see what the’re saying,
 It’s you or me
 
 You’re only small
 
 A boxing ring with blackened walls
 It can only see from the inside
 Across the board
 
 There’s a horror in my head when the blanket is gone
 From the throne in my castle where I see the sun from
 
 There’s a horror in my head when the blanket is gone
 From the throne in my castle where I see the sun from
 
 In the comfort of this room the challenge died
 Remember you and me, we laughed till we cried
 
 In the comfort of this room the challenge died
 Remember you and me, we laughed till we cried
