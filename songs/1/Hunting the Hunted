 Hunting the hunted
 I never wanted
 To play your game
 
 In cold blood
 The penetration
 Turning blue blood red
 I put a hole so deep, so deep within
 
 So deep, so deep within
 
 Hunting the hunted
 I never wanted
 To play your game
 The bullet flies
 In cold blood
 The penetration
 I put a hole so deep, so deep within
 
 Hunting the hunted
 I never wanted
 To play your game
 The bullet flies
 In cold blood
 The penetration
 I put a hole so deep, so deep within
 
 A canned hunt for the wealthy celebrity
 A trophy for the sportsmen
 A murder fix for your ego trip
 Everything to have, and still not satisfied
 Without the animals, what will substitute?
 A murder fix for your ego trip
 
 Hunting the hunted
 I never wanted
 To play your game
 The bullet flies
 In cold blood
 The penetration
 I put a hole so deep, so deep within
