 She waits patiently
 Holding time for me
 Tells me about herself
 
 She writes everything
 Up and down for me
 Keeps it inside herself
 
 As the deception reveals itself
 
 My morality
 A slave to gravity
 My sanity has turned to agony
 
 She hides me away
 Can’t speak or convey
 Secrets about herself
 
 She holds all the things
 That keep her lingering
 I take her inside myself
 
 My morality
 A slave to gravity
 My sanity has turned to agony
