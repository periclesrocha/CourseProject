 The dawn to life
 Lies shattered on the floor
 And I’ve been told
 You’re not coming back no more
 
 Your hands were bleeding
 Your heart was raw
 Your hopes were curved and gutted
 Man of straw
 
 Man of straw
 I’ve been told
 You won’t be back
 Won’t be back
 
 In the sprawl that is suburban
 Lying dormant in a home
 You realized your calling
 In that catatonic role
 
 Man of straw
 Man of straw
 I’ve been told
 You won’t be back
 
 You’ve gone to be a beacon
 Out in space
 Formless, splashing, seeking
 Homeless, in disgrace
 
 [Every corner of my body, even my mind — pure white, shining silver, frozen]
