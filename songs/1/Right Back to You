 I turn the light on, and see your pretty face
 I turn the light off, wishing that I could free space
 I turn away, and know you’re never far away from me
 So I stay for another day
 
 If there’s a way, I’m coming right back to you
 No matter what day, I’m coming right back to you
 If there’s a way, I’m coming right back to you
 No matter what they say, I’m coming right back to you
 
 I learn to run off so I can keep the pace
 And never a moment goes by I wouldn’t trade for your embrace
 Skies of gray, I know you’re never far away from me
 And I stay for another day
 
 If there’s a way, I’m coming right back to you
 No matter what day, I’m coming right back to you
 If there’s a way, I’m coming right back to you
 No matter what they say, I’m coming right back to you
 
 Won’t you stay with me?
 Won’t you stay with me?
 
 If there’s a way, I’m coming right back to you
 No matter what day, I’m coming right back to you
 If there’s a way, I’m coming right back to you
 No matter what they say, I’m coming right back to you
 
 If there’s a way, (stay with me) I’m coming right back to you
 No matter what day, (stay with me) I’m coming right back to you
 No matter which way, (stay with me) I’m coming right back to you
 If there’s a way, (stay with me) I’m coming right back to you
 
 If there’s a way, (stay with me) I’m coming right back to you
 No matter what day, (stay with me) I’m coming right back to you
 No matter which way, (stay with me) I’m coming right back to you
 If there’s a way, (stay with me) I’m coming right back to you
