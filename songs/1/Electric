 It’s electric
 where you find it
 then you touch it
 but it falls down
 
 It’s electric
 where you find it
 and you touch it
 but it falls down
 
 Huh!
 
 There’s a man there
 in my hands here
 with his mouth
 slightly ajar -
 
 When I reach down
 and I touch it
 I know I’ve gone
 too far.
 
 Ah!
 
 Huh!
 
 It’s electric
 where you find it
 and you touch it
 but it falls down
 
 It’s electric
 where you find it
 then you touch it
 but it falls down
 
 Huh!
 
 It’s electric
 where you find it
 and you touch it
 but it falls down
 
 There’s a girl there
 in my dreams here
 with the auburn hair
 and she’s stuck
 
 Underneath
 
 Oh she’s stuck
 underneath me
 
 and there’s nothing I
 can do
 about it.
