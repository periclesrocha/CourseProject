 If I could
 I would take a tree branch
 And ram it inside you
 But it’s already been done
 
 If I could
 I would take a tree branch
 And ram it inside you
 But it’s already been done
 
 If I could
 I would take a tree branch
 And ram it inside you
 Splitting open
 Your heart of palm
 But it’s already been done
 From spoiled plantains
 Crawls out
 Tarantula
