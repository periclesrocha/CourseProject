 I’ve been wasting time
 In your lonesome eyes
 
 I’ve been split in half
 Oh I wanna be
 A perfect match
 
 Pull me up tonight
 By my broken teeth
 And my lies
 
 Face the fire, the fear
 It makes me wild
 Makes me wild
 
 Face the fire, the fear
 It makes me wild
 Makes me wild
 
 I’ve been having fun
 My eyes are closed
 I’m on the run
 
 Hate inside my heart
 It washes over
 Every thought
 
 I’ll always be the one
 When I’m dead and gone
 There’s no one left
 I’m the only one
 I’m the only one
 I’m the only one
 
 I’ve been wasting time
 Oh your begging eyes
 In my mind
 
 Help me to become
 The one who got away
 Fortunate son
 
 Face the fire, the fear
 It makes me wild
 Makes me wild
 
 Face the fire, the fear
 It makes me wild
 Makes me wild
 
 Face the fire, the fear
 It makes me wild
 Makes me wild
 
 Make me wild
