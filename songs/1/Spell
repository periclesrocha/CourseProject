 I have a spell, I know it well
 Dark, dark night
 Pull me in
 
 You lose the light
 I lose that light
 Dark, dark night
 Pull me in
 
 You say the word
 That’s all I ever heard
 Dark, dark night
 Pull me in
 
 Pull me in
 Pull me in
 Pull me in
 Pull me in
 
 I’m gone
 I’m gone
 I’m gone
 I’m gone
 
 I have a spell, I know it well
 Dark, dark night
 Pull me in
 
 Dark, dark night
 Pull me in
 
 Dark, dark night
 Pull me in
 
 Dark, dark night
 Pull me in
