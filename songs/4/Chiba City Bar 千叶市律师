 Two bodies are tangled up tonight amongst themselves in a foggy parking lot
 Hidden beneath the spot of an illuminated lamp post.
 The electricity between them buzzes with each second/ Sparking into another miniature minute.
 His fingers disappeared into the summer highlights of her hair/ and her hands vibrating against the small of his back.
 Their shared heat cools the air as passion secretly instigates the slow dance into slower palpable rituals.
