 It’s just another day
 Million people choosing their ways
 I like to get it out
 Cyber thoughts — heavy gray clouds
 
 Ready for the trip
 A trip — near to the rim
 A higgs must be broken
 Discover the unspoken
 
 And what if I could find you
 Space and gravity behind these clouds?
 And what if you would tell me
 It’s internally and close around?
 
 And what if I could find you
 Space and gravity behind these clouds?
 And what if you would tell me
 It’s internally and close around?
