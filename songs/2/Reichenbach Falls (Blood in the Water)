 Suicide
 You never even wanted to die
 
 Close your eyes
 Hearing signs from the other side
 
 It’s like it didn’t even happen
 It’s like it didn’t even happen
 
 You caught your fingers in the net
 This wasn’t supposed to be romantic
 I hide my lipstick scratch
 It’s like it didn’t even happen
 
 Breathe out
 There’s blood in the water
 
 Breathe out
 There’s blood in the water
 
 Breathe out
 There’s blood in the water
 
 Breathe out
 There’s blood in the water
