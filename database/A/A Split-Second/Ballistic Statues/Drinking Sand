The shadow of an inclination
Burning down the walls
Industrial voodoo
Shortly before the fall

Like fish back into the sea
An ancient, mechanical creed
A voracious kind of sophisticated greed

Another violent breed

The growing pain of urban natives
Slowly taking change
Ballistic sounds of hollow laughter
The end of a sophisticated farce

Driven by a voodoo beat
Onto the primitive concrete

Like another violent breed

The shadow of an inclination
Burning down the walls
Industrial voodoo
Shortly before the fall

Like fish back into the sea
An ancient, mechanical creed
A voracious kind of sophisticated greed

Another violent breed

Another violent breed
Another violent breed
Another violent breed

Another violent breed
Another violent breed
Another violent breed
