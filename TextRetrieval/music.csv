Heaven may running empty yet devil rides 
Hell burns angel turns pillow cooler side 
Something diabolical 

Idle hands bound 
Damned sam went georgia 
Speed forged divine salt 
Mined vaults flame lost 
Named sought fault rests beneath 
The wrong spawned tired screech 
Of essence halted engulfed scent exhaustion 
A false witness sensed end brought 
To bended knees abandoned belief 
The mephistophelian plea wicked unleashed sends 
Heed reap grim infernally decreed 
Reposession vested fallen called retrieve 
Meed fueled intention deprived intervention 
The thundered calm comes rattle descension 
Numbs panicked havoc reeks oil 
Barreling mortal coil 

Heaven may running empty yet devil rides

Even I started blazing chronic sack 
I go wild unfocused troublesome kid 
Looking gangsters shit 
I unimpressionable age faze 
An unmentionable stage deranged full rage 
Walking life haze dark clouds 
Hanging head wicked loud 
And sometimes demons haunt taunt 
Follow pursue confuse want 
They come angles dangles 
Memories front , I wont run away 
I put gun away sometimes hand ditches 
But I ’ want get locked away cause I whack bitches

And I learned spit rhymes without beats 
To say whatever I went going 
Tripping people acting like knowin 
Learn record companies holdin 
Attaching image end controllin 
But set set apart 
And let people know start 
It ’ like Ghostface said studied art form 
We turned mike spit fucking dark storm 
People slept doubted skill level 
But I ’ tenacious I got strong level 
You introduced real rebels 
Injected venom god kill devils

Got gang-sters twenty-five alive 
Never see kids fucking wild 
But ’ game shit ’ change 
Get respect smoking brains 
You get name build rep

’ Neath halo street lamp

When eyes stabbed flash neon light

Ten thousand people , maybe 
People talking without speaking 
People hearing without listening 
People writing songs voices never share 
And one dared 
Disturb sound silence

Silence , like cancer , grows . 
Hear words I might teach .

Watched crimson sunrise 
Imagined might find 
Life filled wonder 
I felt warm wind blow 
I must explore boundaries 
Transcend depth winter 's snow 

Innocence caressing 
I never felt young 
There much life 
Still I longed search 

But days gone 
Changed like leaf tree 
Blown away forever 
Into cool autumn breeze 
The snow fallen 
And sun 's bright 
I struggle hold 
With last might 

In den inequity 
Viciousness subtlety 
Struggle ease pain 
Struggle find 

Ignorance surrounding 
I 've never filled fear 
All life 's drained 
The end drawing near ...

Seize day '' 

I 'll always remember 
The chill November 
The news fall 
The sounds hall 
The clock wall 
Ticking away 
`` Seize Day '' 
I heard say 
Life always way 
Look around 
Hear sounds 
Cherish life 
While 're still around 

( `` Gather ye rosebuds ye may ) 
( Old Time still a-flying ; ) 
( And flower smiles today ) 
( Tomorrow dying '' ) 

We learn 
From past 
But days 
Are gone 
We hope 
For future 
But might one 

The words stuck mind 
Alive I 've learned 
I seize day 
To home I returned 

Preparing flight 
I held might 
Fearing deepest fright 
She walked night 
She turned one last look 
She looked eye 
I said , `` I Love You ... 
Good-bye '' 

( `` It 's awful thing 'll ever hear '' ) 
( `` If 're lying ... '' ) 
( `` Oh , dearly love '' )

( `` Gather ye rosebuds ye may '' )

All lost 
With nothing fulfilled 
Off pages 
T.V . screen 
Another world 
Where nothing 's true 

Tripping 
The life fantastic 
Lose step 
And never get 
Left alone 
With cold blank stare 
I feel like giving 

I blinded paradise 
Utopia high sky 
A dream drowned 
Deep sorrow , wondering 

Oh come let us adore 
Abuse ignore 
No matter 
Do n't let 
Let 's feed upon misery 
Then string world see 

I 'm sick 
Your hypocrites 
Holding bay 
And I n't need 
Your sympathy 
To get day 

Seasons change I 
Hold Boy 
No time cry 
Untie strings

Oh come let us adore 
Abuse ignore 
No matter 
Do n't let

Now 's time 
To deal

A lifetime memories 
Run head

For better worse 
Alive dead

There 's turning back 
Life goes 
The offbeaten track

Set see Crimson Sunset

All hopes left behind 
In time… time 

I rust decay 
With every wasted day 
In sorrow dismay 
My life , fades away 

Is nothing ever built last ? 
Must precious moments always pass 
With regret restrain ? 
A second joy per lifetime pain 

Strung sad refrain 
A second joy per lifetime pain 

Pain fade time 
My dreams get lost time 
And love die time 
As I die time 

In time…

I wear crown thorns pull knife chest 
I keep searching something I never seem find 
But maybe I ’ I left behind 

Now I ’ stuck ’ never change 
Always part last day 
Where go , road travel

Will I try alive 
Will I try ’ cause I ’ never seen light 
Blow ground ’ see

How ’ end alone

Hard breathe ’ underground

How low I keep pretending 
That stars sky could mean something 
Heaven open I live knees 
A man many words man deeds 

Walking streets absent hope 
A pillow concrete , man home 
Lend hand ’ walk way 
Leave virtue pity live shame 

So scared dream world sunlight 
When wake know ’ darker last night 
Quickly forget , sacrifice gone 
Born walk away , walking whole life 

Where ’ go

And mother cried whole way home 

But never said loud 
On way back home thought meant 
When said sister went 

After grandpa got hospice sick 
And could n't fall sleep 
They wheeled stretcher bed beside night 
And I saw light

While us grandkids said goodbyes

Inside living room 
Where I live 
And never go 
A role name alone 

And I pause I second I hear name 
Sometimes I think I see face improbable places 
Do moments replay ? 
When I ’ suddenly ’ go away 
When ’ sitting living room reading afternoon 
Do put book , look try find ? 

Sometimes I think people 
Who lived us 
How spaces memories make 
Change room blueprints 
To place live 

When leave 
When go home 
You take 
But memories echo 

On hardwood floor living room 
Tore carpet , scratches found 
And wine stain couch 
We got drunk decided 
We ’ still try move around 

And I ’ tell difference 
Between ones made 
And ones ’ make 
They conjure images still 
Where sit read 
In sunlight , aware I watch 

And I live alone 
Save echoes 

I live alone 
Save echoes

Because vision softly creeping 
Left seeds I sleeping 
And vision planted brain 
Still remains 
Within sound silence 

In restless dreams I walked alone 
Narrow streets cobblestone 
'Neath halo streetlamp 
I turned collar cold damp 
When eyes stabbed flash neon light 
That split night 
And touched sound silence 

And naked light I saw 
Ten thousand people , maybe 
People talking without speaking 
People hearing without listening 
People writing songs voices never shared 
And one dared 
Disturb sound silence 

`` Fools , '' said I , `` You know 
Silence like cancer grows 
Hear words I might teach 
Take arms I might reach '' 
But words like silent raindrops fell 

Listen sound 
Listen sound echoed 
Listen sound echoed wells silence 

And people bowed prayed 
To neon god made 
And sign flashed warning 
In words forming 
And sign said , `` The words prophets 
Are written subway walls 
And tenement halls 
And whispered sounds silence ''
