0,Right Back At It Again,A Day To Remember,"We’re coming out swinging!

Started out in the spring of 2003
Never went to school, nobody talked to me
Except to tell me all the things I couldn’t do
Don’t want to hear about it
Got with my guys packed into all our cars
Hit all the nearest scenes and every local bar
Played a show a night till it’d make me sick

So here I am
I’m right back at it again
Just like I’ve always said
""If you’re too cool for school
I ain’t here to make no friends""
And I’ll say hey! (Hey)!
I’m right back at it again
Just like I’ve always said
""If you’re too cool for school
I ain’t here to make no friends""

We left home with no kinda back up plan
And everyone we knew that we couldn’t stand
Said if you can’t make it here, you won’t make it there
Don’t want to hear about it
Spent most of our time sleeping on hard wood floors
People’s living rooms in any open door
We played a show a night till it all made sense

So here I am
I’m right back at it again
Just like I’ve always said
""If you’re too cool for school
I ain’t here to make no friends""
And I’ll say hey! (Hey)!
I’m right back at it again
Just like I’ve always said
""If you’re too cool for school
I ain’t here to make no friends""

Don’t wanna hear about it
Don’t wanna hear about it yet

So here I am
I’m right back at it again
Just like I’ve always said
""If you’re too cool for school
I ain’t here to make no friends""
And I’ll say hey!
I’m right back at it again
Just like I’ve always said
""If you’re too cool for school
I ain’t here to make no…"" (Brace for impact!)

Don’t wanna hear about it
Don’t wanna hear about it, bitch

1,"Sometimes You're The Hammer, Sometimes You're The Nail",A Day To Remember,"You wanna take, take, take, take, take it away from me
Take it away from me
You can’t wait, wait, wait, wait, wait till I’m stumbling
Go get carried away

Go!

And the fears sets in, in an instant
Too much of myself gets exposed
This is where I go at my weakest
When I don’t have to be scared to tell the truth

Tend to do my best when everything goes wrong
That’s why sad songs make me happy, ’cause I don’t have to feel alone

You wanna take, take, take, take, take it away from me
Take it away from me
You can’t wait, wait, wait, wait, wait till I’m stumbling
No, you’ve got me wrong
Oh the nights are long with no one else around
You wanna take, take, take, take, take it away from me
Go get carried away

It’s never what you’ve done, it’s what you’ve done lately
Who cares what you’re saying, if no one’s listening
You don’t have to like me, but you’re gonna respect me
I that came from nothing, leave hope in my wake

I got no regrets, but have my days with doubt
To those left in sadness I’ll be the one to lead you out

You wanna take, take, take, take, take it away from me
Take it away from me
You can’t wait, wait, wait, wait, wait till I’m stumbling
No, you’ve got me wrong
Oh the nights are long with no one else around
You wanna take, take, take, take, take it away from me
Go get carried away

I reserve my right to feel uncomfortable reserve, my right to be afraid
I make mistakes and I am humbled every step of the way
I want to be a better person, I wanna know the master plan
Cast your stones, cast your judgement, you don’t make me who I am

I reserve my right to feel uncomfortable reserve, my right to be afraid
I make mistakes and I am humbled every step of the way
I want to be a better person, I wanna know the master plan
Cast your stones, cast your judgement, you don’t make me who I am

God help those who help themselves, and forget about everyone else
You lost your nerve, you missed the point
God help those with open hands, may they never feel burden again
Yeah I’ll stand up for those who can’t
I’ll close the distance

2,The Document Speaks For Itself,A Day To Remember,"You’re all about you, and it’s my fast track to an early grave.
Just need to see this through
Do you even sleep at night?
Where does your conscience run to hide?

I gotta get out, I gotta get out.
Why can’t you just do what’s right by me?
I gotta get out, I gotta get out.
It can’t get much harder, harder to breathe.

The room keeps spinning faster, I’m drifting off to sleep.
Hope it’s seen beyond these walls you’re suffocating me.
Why can’t you see what three little words have done to me?
I never knew I was alone, you turned your back, you broke this home.
Took me so long to find the answers, and your reasons why.
I just wanted things to be alright, or at least for just tonight.

How’s living a lie?
You never could face me,
And you hide behind fake personalities
Because deep down you’re scared.
So weak beyond compare.

I gotta get out, I gotta get out.
Why can’t we just go our separate ways?
I gotta get out, I gotta get out.
It won’t be much farther, I’m counting the days.

The room keeps spinning faster, I’m drifting off to sleep.
Hope it’s seen beyond these walls, you’re suffocating me.
Why can’t you see what three little words have done to me?
I never knew I was alone, you turned your back, you broke this home.
Took me so long to find the answers, and your reasons why.
I just wanted things to be alright, or at least for just tonight.

My friends still stand behind me.
We stuck together through all we lost.
Even when your worst surrounds me, you’ll never get the best of us.

Why can’t you see what three little words have done to me?
I never knew I was alone, you turned your back, you broke this home.
Took me so long to find the answers, and your reasons why.
I just wanted things to be alright, or at least for just tonight

No fucking respect.

All hail the thief forever trying to separate you and me.
All hail the thief forever trying to separate
No fucking respect.

I never thought I’d meet a girl like you
Meet a girl like you

With auburn hair and tawny eyes
The kind of eyes that hypnotize me through
You hypnotize me through

And I ran
I ran so far away
I just ran
I ran all night and day
I couldn’t get away

A cloud appears above your head
A beam of light comes shining down on you
Shining down on you

The cloud is moving nearer still
Aurora Borealis comes in view
Aurora comes in view

And I ran
I ran so far away
I just ran
I ran all night and day
I couldn’t get away

Reached out a hand to touch your face
You’re slowly disappearing from my view
Disappearing from my view

Reached out a hand to try again
I’m floating in a beam of light with you
A beam of light with you

And I ran
I ran so far away
I just ran
I ran all night and day

And I ran
I ran so far away

5,Magdalena,A Perfect Circle,"Overcome by your moving temple
Overcome by this holiest of altars
So pure, so rare,
To witness such an unearthly goddess
That I’ve lost my self-control
Beyond compelled to throw this dollar
Down before your
Holiest of altars

I’d sell my soul, my self-esteem
A dollar at a time
For one chance, one kiss,
One taste of you, my Magdalena

I bear witness to this place,
This prayer, so long forgotten
So pure, so rare
To witness such an unearthly goddess

That I’d sell my soul, my self-esteem

6,The Hollow,A Perfect Circle,"Run, desire, run
Sexual being
Running like a blade
To and through the heart, no conscience
One Motive: cater to the hollow

Screaming
“Feed me here, fill me up again”
Temporarily pacify this hunger
That’s so cruel

Libido
Throw dominoes of indiscretions down
Falling all around in cycles,
In circles
Constantly consuming,
Conquer and devour

Cause it’s time to bring the fire down
Bridle all this indiscretion
Long enough to edify
And permanently fill this hollow

Screaming
“Feed me here, fill me up again”
Temporarily pacifying

Feed me here, fill me up again
Temporarily pacifying

7,Mambo Witch,A Split-Second,"A startling sense of dislocation
Pushed away by voodoo crap
Spill your poison somewhere else
Can’t shake the needles from your back

Guns and chains, emotional drains
Cutting it down to size
Captured by the hindu curse
that holds your mesmerized

Slice my throat, stiletto knife
to keep my burning hope alive
The long black hair that smells like incense
turns to vipers in my mind

You foul the pyramids with your presence
Holding in your tiny claws
The snakes that feed the witch with venom
Too late, no time to withdraw

Mambo witch
Mambo witch

Sound of torture and moral exhaustion
Barely concealed by telephone wires

Heal the wounds and lick the scars
Screw up your eyes to read your stars
She is fire, I am ice
Bound to burn at any price

I want to kill you…

8,Flesh,A Split-Second,"This is when your flesh
Crimson and pale
Withers behind the blackened veil

The vacant flesh
A petrifying look
The choice is easy
The outcome always the same

The shortest way to cardiac arrest

The flish that dreams are made of
Doesn’t last

This is when you turn
To sanctimonious rituals

The duty of the beast

The duty of the beast

When we were younger and free

Before the world fell at our feet

To tell you I’m sorry
For breaking your heart
But it don’t matter
It clearly doesn’t tear you apart

About myself, I’m sorry

Did you ever make it out of that town
Where nothing ever happened?

It’s no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time

The faces of those you’ve hurt, they cannot even be seen,
But you’ll never forget the one (who you meet) in the dark.

Within this place I’ve sensed no evil,
Only the absence of hurt that I had felt.
Death holds my heart and keeps me imprisoned
To shield me from another fall.

Without caution I moved towards nothing
And you have seen me somehow.
The imperfection in your mirrored reflection of a beauty
That died inside of me.

Darkness comforts me in this moment,

I want to embrace you, hold you.
The mind is plagued with the morbid hesitation.
Just tell me you’re suffering

The darkness in your eyes…

You found me in this, I found you a rose… of death.
Do I want you, could you want me?
Accept my bouquet of decay.
Am I an image that comforts your fantasy
Or will this surface turn my dark reality?
Are you the one, am I the one?
The wraiths have left me.
And sun will kill us, suddenly kill us.

I want to embrace you, hold you.

Sadness waits to claim our fall
And mourn for love that seeks its savior

Darkness finds me in my fate
The beautiful face which may bring salvation
Souls embrace a shattering wound
Have I strength to admit my desperation?

Please save me from apathy
That drains my sympathy
Just speak those words that need to be
You can’t promise to never die

Even angels have to die
But love is worth the tears that it brings me
I’ll bleed with you ’til I am drained
Though my color may be less than perfect

Could the intent be to invade
This place where nothing dreams eternal?
Fear that you’ll be torn away
Had lead me to my own decay

This thought of wasting haunts my mind
For my heart can’t lose another angel

Please save me from apathy
That drains my sympathy
Just speak those words that need to be
You can’t promise to never die

And since that day

And corpses greet our tired eyes

There was no turning back
And now they all are gone

Their bodies lying where they fell
Suffering, anguish and despair
As they went through living hell

Pretty flowers in the gardens of the town
Change or the sun won’t shine

But now it’s the end of the in-between
Gone are the days
When the ammunition was clean

Change or the sun won’t shine

Outside stories of misdemeanors grow
Seeing the blade in the rays
Running for cover they go, too late
How they come and how they fall
Baby cradle and all
Baby cradle and all

Close the door
Though it seems like we only kissed hello
It looks like it’s time to go
It looks like it’s time to go in the light
Somehow the craziness dissolves
Change or the sun won’t shine (change or the sun won’t shine)
Change or we end it all

You know they’re here when the water is red
Our fading life support is hanging by a thread

A message etched on broken ships

Hey, hey, they live this, day and night
This is sacrifice, no fucking compromise
Hey, hey, they have the heart to resist
Whilst the hunters hunt they will persist

You can hear them cry
They’re calling out to the Mother, lost
She’s bleeding out

She’s bleeding out

Their innocence is heaven sent
Their malevolence, it will not relent
A graveyard sits upon the shore
They won’t swim together anymore

The tide will rush with waves of fear
Selling souls, the devil is near
The tide will rush with waves of fear
Selling souls, the devil is near

The devil is near

""If we’re going to survive on this planet
We have to respect the right of all species to survive
For we need them more than they need us""

A message etched on broken ships
We’ll be here till corruption quits
There is a voice though they cannot speak
Not yet ready to admit defeat

You can hear them cry
They’re calling out to the Mother, lost
She’s bleeding out
You can hear them cry
They’re calling out to the Mother, lost
She’s bleeding out

Where tragedy is bought and sold
It seems their pain is worth its weight in gold

You don’t know what it feels like to be in my shoes
You turned your back on me as I stood there and fell to the floor
This time there’s no reason for me to turn around and scream for help
But if only you were here to hold my head above all those things you said to tie me down

I could creep up beside put a gun in your mouth
Makes me sick when I hear all the shit that you say
So much crap coming out, it must take you all day

There’s a space kept in hell with your name on the seat
With a spike in the chair just to make it complete
When you look at yourself do you see what I see
If you do why the fuck are you looking at me?
Why the fuck are you looking at me?
Why the fuck are you looking at me?

Can you please hurry up ’cause I find you obscene
We can’t wait for the day that you’re never around

To have this chance, to have this chance again
To have this chance, to have this chance
And know there’s more than this and know there’s more than you

Like those gasping for their last breath
We cannot hide there’s nothing left

Like those gasping for their last breath
We cannot hide there’s nothing left

149,The Sound Of Truth,As I Lay Dying,"Yeah

We have all heard what we wanted to hear
Truth that sounds right to our ears

We have all heard what we wanted to hear
Truth that sounds right to our ears

But what wisdom is there within us
To live based on the feeling of our hearts?
How many times has instinct let us down
Never to be thought through
Never to be questioned

No

Say what you really mean
When your ambition calls you
Calls you
For what use is there in praying
If you will only hear what you want to hear?

We have all heard what we wanted to hear
Truth that sounds right to our ears

Yeah

We speak of fighting to resist this world
But what about the battle within us? (Yeah)
If we have chosen to live against the grain
Then why are we all facing the same way?

There is no difference between us and them
If we all blindly seek truth from sentiments

We have all heard what we wanted to hear
Truth that sounds right to our ears

We have all heard what we wanted to hear
Truth that sounds right to our ears

We have all heard what we wanted to hear
Truth that sounds right to our ears

150,This Is Who We Are,As I Lay Dying,"Now this is who we are
I am no one’s
I am no one’s hero
I am no one
For we are not the giant men
That some may think
YOU are faithful when we are not
So I’d like to tell this story
The way it is meant to be

Without the burden that’s in our hearts
None of us would have ever found YOU
For YOU are faithful when we are not
YOU began a work
That only YOU can complete

Now this is who we are
I’ll never know the answers
And I’ll always wonder why
Now this is who we are
I’ll never know the answers
And I’ll always wonder why

Why we are given grace we’ll never deserve
And a second chance that we will never earn
For there is nothing I can do to save myself
For there is nothing I can do

Now this is who we are
I’ll never know the answers
And I’ll always wonder why
Now this is who we are
I’ll never know the answers
And I’ll always wonder why
And I’ll always

Now this is who we are
I’ll never know the answers
And I’ll always wonder why
But YOU have let me start again
I’d rather be called weak
Than die thinking I was strong

151,Within Destruction,As I Lay Dying,"If music is a mirror revealing the depths of my heart
Then I will write the darkest song for without forgiveness my soul is lost

All that is hope within destruction comes from you for I have fallen
All that is hope within destruction comes from you for I have fallen, fallen

If music is a mirror revealing the depths of my heart
Then I will write the darkest song for without forgiveness my soul is lost

All that is hope within destruction comes from you

Yeah, yeah, yeah

For I have fallen and there is nothing good within me
Yet I’ve been given life I will, I will never deserve
For without forgiveness, for without forgiveness my soul is lost

All that is hope within destruction
All that is hope within destruction
All that is hope within destruction
All that is hope within destruction

All that is hope

All that is hope
All that is hope

152,Wrath Upon Ourselves,As I Lay Dying,"I can only imagine that wrath is being held out
So there will be time for us to be redeemed
But surely wrath is not being held out
So that we may redeem ourselves
For I’ve seen the madness
Of those who died trying
But is regret only a word that the living possess?
I long to see their faces
Regardless of the decay
For in the eyes of the deceased…

We would see hope in our last day
Inside this dying world
For there is still beauty
Inside this dying world

For what good is there holding off wrath
If we are determined
To bring wrath upon ourselves

155,Cauterize,As I Lay Dying,"Go!

The Truth of my heart
is like a repressed tale

A censored and silenced story
Repression or restraint
It is a delicate balance
Between bleeding out what
will make me drown
And closing in what I cannot afford to spill
Either way, I must cauterize, cauterize the open wound

I’m caught between the feeling
Of being pulled apart
or stuffed into a cell
or stuffed into a cell

And if these are the only options
This will be always be hell
Never ending
Though I still may be breathing
There is no quality of life
So I choose to risk it all for you
For you to be by my side

I’m caught between the feeling
Of being pulled apart
or stuffed into a cell
or stuffed into a cell

A crowd is easy to deceive
But now I am a patient on the table
I’ll give you the knife
Cut away as you see fit
Just promise me the patience
To wait for me to heal

I’m caught between the feeling
Of being pulled apart
Or stuffed into a cell
Or stuffed into a cell
Or stuffed into a cell

Fighting so hard to be heard
Yet having nothing to say
You talk about changing masses
But forget those close to you

Most of us have given up
On these words that all sound the same
But I am still willing to believe
If you have done all that you can

You can justify almost anything
If you are willing to be loud enough
But once you’ve spent everything
To change the world around you
Even if your voice is taken away
Such actions will still inspire

Most of us have given up
On these words that all sound the same
But I am still willing to believe
If you have done all that you can

Drained
Spent
Determined
Intent
Now you’ve earned the right to be heard

We’ve been deceived by elegant speech
Whose only concern is mere distraction

Drained

Now you’ve earned the right to be heard

But I am still willing to believe
If you have done all that you can

I am willing to die

157,My Only Home,As I Lay Dying,"Like a swarm of flies colliding with a moving windshield
So are our lives on this never-ending road
I have left behind my mark only to later be washed away
And was consumed with the allure despite the inevitable decay

When did the road that I’m on become my only home?
When did this become the one place I truly know?
(I truly know)

A journey making us like weeds
Where the wind steals our splendor
But spreads it to the distant fields
Despite our fragile imperfections
Yet shaking walls and wearing wheels
Can never capture my heart the way you do

When did the road that I’m on become my only home?
(my only home)
When did this become the one place I truly know?

I am missing what makes me whole

158,No Lungs to Breathe,As I Lay Dying,"I fought who I am inside
Until I wanted, I wanted to die
Instead of finding balance I found hatred
Consumed by failures and ignoring my own strengths
Pushed out to sea without learning to swim
Or stranded in the desert with no lungs to breathe

With no lungs to breathe
I had almost lost everything

How can I be expected to readily be content
With a view of life that has rejected
The basis of what has helped me to survive?
And replaced them with precepts
Rather than instruction
Full rule is an illusion (illusion)
All I can do is contain selfishness
And unveil what little power we may have

With no lungs to breathe
I had almost lost everything (everything)

Tearing away my flesh before taking
The time to understand it
A miracle may not be the answer
(tearing away my flesh)
When anchoring first on what I have
(before taking the time to understand it)
The ability to change

Like being stranded in the desert
With no lungs to breathe

With no lungs to breathe
I had almost lost everything (everthing)

159,Overcome,As I Lay Dying,"All these moments of pain
Must add up to something
Our bodies have been trained to keep it all in
But our hearts still hold on

Some say to release it, forget about your past
Instead we count the cost, it’s part of us
That doesn’t mean that we cannot move on
It’s just a memory of what we once were

No matter what it is we’ve faced
It’s now part of us (part of us)
We can overcome

Why rid of fuel that can make us stronger
When properly put behind us? (put behind us)
And in the same way that
Everything good in life can be taken away
So can all this pain

No matter what it is we’ve faced
It’s now part of us (part of us)
No matter what we’ve faced in this life
We can overcome

Trying to forget is a burden we can never bear
When facing trials openly
There’s nothing left to hide
New paths of strength come alive

We can overcome

No matter what it is we’ve faced
It’s now part of us (part of us)
No matter what we’ve faced in this life
We can overcome

160,Resilience,As I Lay Dying,"Your resilience inspires me
Facing tragedies I will never face
Your presence is humbling
To think of all that you have overcome
It took such little pain
For our lives to coalesce
Finding what I could’ve found in no one else

You bring me through the darkness of myself
And show me that frailty can be turned to strength

Suffering
Persistence
Such sorrow
Yet resilience

From the outside I’ve deceived the world
With false bravery
Yet you have taught me so much more
Much more than I can ever teach
And someday you might
Need someone to lean on

I can only hope that I’ll have gained the courage
To be there for you in whatever you face
You bring me trough (you bring me through)
The darkness of myself
And show me that frailty (can be turned)
Can be turned to strength

Suffering
Persistence
Such sorrow
Yet resilience

At times I’m carried on the shoulders of a child
I find power in your firm fallibility
My source of hope is seeing that weak prevail
And I’m better able to live because you’re alive
I could not imagine a world without you
Where I looked you in the eyes and left you to die

Suffering
Persistence
Such sorrow
Yet resilience

161,Tear Out My Eyes,As I Lay Dying,"The storm is coming and I have a choice
To accept nature or lose my voice
Shall I scream and plead for nothing
Or build a roof over my head?
I mourn the days that I wasted
Trying to change what has been set
Fighting against myself

Before I tear, tear out my eyes
I’ll just admit they’re part of me

I’ve labelled enemies who do not hate me
And then claims friends who could care less
All an unnecessary struggle
So now I know what it means to repent
Changing everything

Before I tear, tear out my eyes
I’ll just admit they’re part of me
(they’re part of me)

Instead of fighting against myself
I will open my eyes
To find who needs me
I am awakened
I am awakened

Before I tear, tear out my eyes
I’ll just admit they’re part of me
(they’re part of me)
I am awakened

162,Unwound (Awakened B Side Demo),As I Lay Dying,"I see no reason to try and be what I am not
If simple honesty moves me, then why should I care?
Others may think I lost my poetic way (I’ve lost my way)
But I’d rather make my point without confusion

I have failed those who I love the most
And in the process become aware

I have accepted there is so much that I don’t know
I have accepted my limitations

It is that knowledge that opens the door
For greater understanding
Perspective on what is still untold

I have accepted there is so much that I don’t know
I have accepted my limitations
I have accepted there is so much that I’ll never know
I have accepted my limitations

Sorting out my thoughts, that is why I write
Though I reveal my weakness surrendering is remedy
These songs have helped me though my greatest pain
Unwound within me the disorder of my life

I now see things for how they are
Even if that is a harsh reality

I have accepted there is so much that I don’t know
I have accepted my limitations
I have accepted there is so much that I’ll never know
I have accepted my limitations

163,Wasted Words,As I Lay Dying,"There are days when sorrow seems never-ending
Like the countless roads upon which I’ve driven
The price of attachment in pursuit of dreams
That I so often can’t seem to remember
Yet there are days when beauty cannot be contained
It even crawls out from under ordinary things

A foreigner, no place to go
Holding on, making the most
Of what little time I have

All the wasted words I said
In all the cities that I left
The last act of our precious play
Must not close with regret

I will not leave wishing I had done things differently

The moments I treasure are seldom the ones
That I planned for
And if I knew where pain hid I might still let it go
So when the audience has run toward the latest drift
It will be my time to face the life that I have set

A foreigner in my own home
Holding on, no place to go

All the wasted words I said
In all the cities that I left
The last act of our precious play
Must not close with regret (regret)
All the wasted words

Some days the line between peace
And pain seems more like a blur
But I know with certainty
I can’t leave wishing, I cannot leave
I can’t leave wishing I’d done things differently

All the wasted words I said
In all the cities that I left
The last act of our precious play
Must not close with regret (regret)
All the wasted words

Now suffering under the weight of my choices
And I hardly recognize myself
Somewhere along the line
There stopped being lines at all
(whispering silence)

Whispering silence
The subtle contradiction
Compromise creeps in
Forgetting who I once was
Slowly changing
Who I once was

Each moment seemed so small
When looked at by itself
But it adds up
And it has torn me down
All lines are gone
(whispering silence)

Whispering silence
The subtle contradiction
Compromise creeps in
Forgetting who I once was
Slowly changing
Who I once was

So close the truth
But still impossible

It was never one thing
And too many to try to add up
Fueled by faint deception
Conflict without acknowledging opposition

All because I had taken pride in my hidden lies

Whispering silence
The subtle contradiction
Compromise creeps in
Forgetting who I once was
Slowly changing
Who I once was
It was never one thing
And too many to try to add up

I am able to bring You nothing that isn’t already Yours

never meant to give

it was the comfort of a friend

171,Falling Upon Deaf Ears,As I Lay Dying,"The sound of silent voices surveying my thoughts
Regularity defining perfection
Neither sorrow nor contentment
Whispering emptiness.

Frail words collapse
My weight only stirs the ground
How long can I hold your hand as you walk over graves?

You search for tears of compassion
Yet find the comfort of winter
Reassurance dead like the falling leaves
Losing hope in your unchanging ways
All of my strength cannot save you
If you are unwilling to help yourself.

and all i knew is what had overtaken me
with no reason i am comforted by inability to understand

With mistaken guilt and shame

Against this endless ocean of self defeat

Puddles of ink
Surround this tired chair
All of my sorrow has been spilled
Into my reflection

If my commitments is only failure, is only failure

What is love without…?

At me and the way you drew me close
With one deep sigh scattering
Pieces of my restless mind
Forgetting all that we have left behind

Through the darkest nights
While your eyes rest in

189,Anger and Apathy,As I Lay Dying,"I’ve tried to find reconciliation behind the walls of those whose hatred burns.
For I find it easier to reach someone who still feels,
Than to make amends with passionless apathy.
Where all lines are the same a portrait cannot be made.

I need to burn inside. I need to know that you are alive.

I need to know that feelings of discontent are stronger
Than indifference for those too weak to stand.

Like a colorless sky over a sea of nothingness,
Hatred faces its enemies while apathy strikes furtively.

I need to burn inside. I need to know that you are alive.

I need to know that feelings of discontent are stronger
Than indifference for those too weak to stand.
I need to know that feelings of discontent are stronger
Than indifference for those too weak to stand…

Until our anger burns against injustice, we will create
The faceless by dismissing those forced to concede.

Many of us have turned off the light outside, erasing what exists beyond our front door.
And for you I find it harder to reach common ground than my most glaring opposition.
But what about those who’ve lost the luxury of choice?
…striving for identity, buried by our lack of interest, souls marked as mere history.
How much grievance will it take to awaken us?

I need to know that feelings of discontent are stronger
Than indifference for those too weak to stand.
I need to know that feelings of discontent are stronger
Than indifference for those too weak to stand…

How much grievance will it take to awaken us from the comfort of our homes?
…the comfort of our oversized graves.

I’ve tried to find reconciliation… I’ve tried to find reconciliation…

190,Anodyne Sea,As I Lay Dying,"None of this matters, none of these words. Common and silent we will die in this world.
We’ve only spoken to those who agree, and without them we’ve fallen on deaf ears.

Stand on conviction and you will walk alone.

For once I have stood (I have stood), no one will know,
But alone I was born and alone we must go.

In my convictions I’ve found my own grave, but amongst the dead we all fade away.

Yeah…
Yet solitude is better than a life not worthy of reaction.
There is nothing to lose (nothing). So we stand alone or join those who follow in misery.

In my convictions I’ve found my own grave, but amongst the dead we all fade away.
In my convictions I’ve found my own grave, but amongst the dead we all fade away.
Fade away…

Stand on conviction and you’ll walk alone.
A voice is only a noise without someone to hear,
And without a crowd to feed that noise grows silent.

For once I have stood, no one will know, but alone I was born and alone we must go.
Fading back into an anodyne sea, to drown with all who’ve gone before me.

Yeah… We must go.

In my convictions I’ve found my own grave (my own grave),
But amongst the dead we all fade away. Yeah…
In my convictions (convictions), I’ve found my own grave,

191,Beyond Our Suffering,As I Lay Dying,"What we see now is only a fraction…

Bound to learn the hard way
This is the human condition
There is nothing that can be said
To stop us from making mistakes
When I look to myself as a source of ending pain
No matter how many times before I’ve failed

It seems our problems solve themselves
When we look beyond us to those truly in hell

The more I focus on myself
Then the more helpless that I become
So why not erase this point of view?
My suffering is trivial (Beyond our suffering)
Compared to those who know real agony

It seems our problems solve themselves
When we look beyond our suffering
It seems our problems solve themselves
When we look beyond our suffering

My trials seem insignificant now

Why won’t we look beyond us?
Why won’t we look beyond our despair?
It seems our problems solve themselves
When we look to those truly in hell

Personal redemption cannot change the world
Unless we lay down our lives for those who still suffer

Without acknowledgment they’re made less than human.

Condemned… Condemned to anonymity. Trapped by… Trapped by obscurity.

Ohhhh…
They will never share our blood, yet is that reason to
Drain what’s left of theirs, abandoning compassion?

Condemned… Condemned to anonymity. Trapped by… Trapped by obscurity.

193,Parallels,As I Lay Dying,"We are all comatose. We are overfed and under…undernourished, yearning for something more.
Never starving yet never quite satisfied. Carnal but without useful flesh or mind. Yeah…

I am a walking contradiction that’s found consistency
Consuming everything, all without producing sustenance.

In the parallels we struggle… struggle to upkeep, there is a better way for us to be set free.
From all it is we crave, there must be more to life than to simply stay alive… to simply stay alive.

We are not the same as I hope to show. There is a better way if we just let go.
We are not… we are not the same. We are not… we are not the same. Let go…

In the tension between devouring want or simple need
It’s clear the only lines between the ones we preserve.

We are not the same as I hope to show. There is a better way if we just let go.

194,The Blinding of False Light,As I Lay Dying,"I see now, I see through the veil of expectation.
I see now, I see that conformity is betrayal.

Betrayal of those who are forgotten, yet vision alone furthers our blame.
Unless followed by transformation, it is pointless to be given sight.
Without the hope of our reaction, we overlook the purpose of our eyes.

Now is our chance to breathe without tyranny, released from the blinding of false light.
(blinding of false light)
Now is our chance to breathe without tyranny. In weakness we are freed.

I see now, I see that conformity is betrayal.

With empty eyes I’ve looked ahead (ahead), with clarity I now look back.

195,The Only Constant is Change,As I Lay Dying,"The only constant is change. The only constant is change. Go…

The human heart is born without legs, sliding back and forth,
And never once does it truly rest, unless accompanied by death… Sliding back and forth.

Even the strongest remnants of history, they have begun to crumble against time.
Sliding back and forth.

The only constant is change. Nothing remains the same.
The only constant is change. There's only growth or decay. Yea…

Let's go… Unvarying scenes only found in pictures can never breathe life.
For nowhere else does level ground exist, unless it has been captured by a flash of steady light.

Sliding back and forth (back and forth).
The only constant is change. Uncertainty awaits.
The only constant is change. There's only growth or decay… or decay.
The only constant is change…

There is nothing that stays the same, from the foundation of our lives.

196,The Plague,As I Lay Dying,"Just like the spread of disease… Ya… Ya…
Debt and guilt or guilt and decree, the masters that we please.
Yet if we seek help for infirmities, we are made twice the sons of hell as before.

Reach out your hand. Reach out your hand, only to be plagued by disease.
Reach out your hand. Reach out your hand, only to be plagued by disease.

While religion tries to blame what we cannot see, I accept that part of the problem is me.
It was never a sacred mandate to accept conformity,
Through select revelations that we choose to believe.

Another blind guide replacing divine eyes.

Familiarity is the great deception, disguised by authority, sealing out subversion.

Whitewashed tombs have hidden the truth, for we unknowingly worship icons of ordinary life.

Reach out your hand to find forgiveness, only to be plagued by disease.
The horrors of beliefs and customs, camouflaged by commonality.

Reach out your hand, reach out your hand. Reach out your hand, reach out your hand.

I still believe that there is hope for us, but I believe we must look outside
The sanctuaries of oppression that have brought our world so much pain…

Yeah…

197,Upside Down Kingdom,As I Lay Dying,"Many choose to find their hope in the thoughts of afterlife
When there is none to be found right here before we die
So I understand the feeling of helplessness
When we are just taught to wait here, wait here for death

Wait here for death
Wait for this suffering to end
Wait here for death, wait here for death
Wait for this suffering to end

We are not forgotten, for a kingdom is offered beyond that of golden streets
We can represent now what will one day be complete

Simplicity is not a curse where strength is humbled
And the powerless rise (and the powerless rise)
This is a kingdom born upside-down
This is a kingdom where the broken are crowned

Wait here for death, wait here for death
The ""blessings"" of excess are only a burden on us

It is a broken system where we just wait for death
It is a broken system where suffering can never end

Simplicity is not a curse where strength is humbled
And the powerless rise (and the powerless rise)
This is a kingdom born upside-down
This is a kingdom where the broken are crowned, the broken are crowned

If helplessness is our system then we’re better off upside-down

198,Vacancy,As I Lay Dying,"We live in slavery to a past we cannot escape, and I say it's worth it to just start again… again.

We've focused so long on ideals of freedom that it is this very belief that oppresses us.
We all want to be free, yet we find ways to forfeit liberty
To our own impulses, to our own consumption.

So I say it's worth it to build a new foundation… a new foundation…
A new foundation… a new foundation… It's a past we cannot escape.

This vacancy will take everything this world can offer.
But what is control once we have let go of all we suffer? Once we've let go…

Yeah… When we've awakened to admit we are all enslaved,
Then there is freedom in our choice to disobey. Yeah…
Our creeds have become a justification (justification) to live the way that some see fit,
(justification) and no one is more hopeless than those blinded by the scales of content.

This vacancy will take everything this world can offer.
But what is control (what is control) once we have let go of all we suffer?

199,Without Conclusion,As I Lay Dying,"Yeah…

If we chase acclaim in search for…search for stature,
Then our status becomes a vacuum draining. Opulence is a myth for there is no final rest.
Change in circumstance only delays. The inescapable fact that we are downcast.

In looking to the end we’ve lost sight of where to begin.

Hope lies not in reaching…reaching the end, if the journey itself is enough to bring fulfillment.

Without conclusion this song will end. Without conclusion there is no final rest.
Without conclusion… Shred…

We are void of purpose before we start.
For in chasing our destination the present state is sacrificed… sacrificed.
In looking to… In looking to the end we have lost sight of where to begin.

Why was I so blind and fucking dumb to see

If there's a black hole headed for hell then baby count me in
I sold my soul so long ago, a bullet in the chamber with nowhere to go
If there's a black hole headed for hell then baby count me in

I sold my soul

Some have said that I'm the devil and it's just as well 'cause
I've been through and burned down and rebuilt hell
With my heart in a vice and a knife in my back
I've got a noose for the world that I'm painting black

Organized puppets fools, fiction on a screen
Lost in the freedom we found
Greed and control, cameras on everything

The watching eye, government spies
Paid to tell lies and in the end who wins
Pow so it all falls down
It all falls down

Hell on earth
Man created the devil and the devil created the excuse
To justify the killings
That we don’t see on the news
And I wonder: Will history repeat itself?
When they’re numbering you

They’ll try to hurt you
Through the good they see in you
Don’t let it break you
Don’t let it break you

They’ll try to punish you
For the good they see in you
They know they need it
Don’t let it break you

Knock, knock mocking bird stop bang
And another one’s down
Fuck your 2 seconds and we lay down flat
Face to the ground, face to the ground, face to the ground
If they had their way we’d be face to the ground
Face to the ground, face to the ground
If they had their way we’d be face to the ground
So we can’t back down

The world is far from being safer
Cypher spend you life in danger
Prosecute me
How can a man exist in this and still be free?
Third eye is eternally on standby
They’re numbering you

Then you can have it
If you want it all
Just take it

Data hell or road to freedom

And they can be used to help humanity

Public enemies as far as you can see
They’re loading their guns and marching the streets
A flag with no meaning, a religion of deceit
You can’t arrest the idea

New blood
End of the dark night clouds clear run free

New blood
No more waiting, don’t buy what they’re saying

New blood
What the hell are they talking about
Stuck in a rut and we must get out

New blood
Too much is at stake

High tech, low life, digits without numbers
I’m sick of running
I see the masses without people
And I know for sure that I can’t trust it anymore

Governments pointing guns at their own people
It has come that far
Invent your god, praise a lie
You can’t arrest the idea

Two halves can make a whole
Aren’t we all the genetic product
Of two completely different people?
We all hold the key to it all

Waiting for the air to get cold
I can’t even notice a slight variation
Of pressure is pressure is pressure

Then they followed them blindly
As if they had no responsibility or control over their own lives

Feels like a bullet tear a chunk out of you shoulder you know

Transducer

Standing on a rooftop, staring down
The sound of a helicopter approaches from far away
Traffic below, stars above

They call me transducer
Transducer

They wanna take me out, out, out, out
I got the identity of another man
A copy of a man of a copy

Stranded, it couldn’t drive me insane
I jump into the big unknown

It couldn’t drive me insane

Darkness would end this life
But I’m still falling
Lights, flashing lights
Is this death?

You matter not because of who you once were
Or where you came from
You matter because of who you are in this moment

You control your convictions, character and values
You as an individual, you matter
They frame you, they limit you
Before you can take your chance

Identity
Become plenty
When you’re anonymous, no mob can find you
Discriminate against you, bully or segregate you

He heard him holler ""Stop!""

For Frosty the snow man
Had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye saying

The beasts of the alley
We are the living dead
Living in your nightmares

Scraping ourselves from the earth
Living as though we are dirt
Staring like you've seen a ghost
The lowest of the low with nowhere to go

Back from the dead, now we're groveling at your feet
Handcuffed for lying our heads as we're withering in the streets
Back from the dead, now we're groveling at your feet
Handcuffed for lying our heads as we're withering in the streets

Fighting for your attention, begging for your generosity
Looking up just to see you turn your cheek on me
You walk on by like I'm invisible, invisible
All I want is to be seen as an equal

We fought your battles and we built your homes
Sorry if I disturbed you, I just wish we could live like you do

Even in our most beautiful days it's dark
Just look at the world around you
There's a consequence for what we do
Pass judgment on me as you walk
Picture perfect ain't my obsession
You can't sum up my life from a first impression

Learn your lesson

Act like you know me but do you even know yourself?
When you got nothin', you got nothin' to lose
Act like you know me but do you even know yourself?
When you got nothin', you got nothin' to lose

I may have no one else to blame (But listen to me)

With thoughts repressed deep down inside?
I guess you just loved the lie
Truth is, you can't decide where my heart resides

I wish I had said it, the words to admit to you who I am
My entire life I was dealt the wrong hand
And cast aside from the man that I am

I've never felt so free
It kills me to hear you say you ""choose to love me""
I was hoping that would be a given, given our history
I've never felt so free, so free

243,Majoring In The Minors,August Burns Red,"These windy streets tell of a different time
What got us here won't get us there
It's time for the upright to have insight
Don't forget what's important in life
This place is like a cage that will imprison you
Is comfort only found without adversity?
Anyone, anywhere in history, has confronted these realities

What got us here won't get us there
I'll be there soon that's why I care

Everyone you love will one day fade away
Everything you have will rot and decay
Everything around us will burn
Burn up in the death of the sun

It's in the pain that we see our true selves change
In the sea of difficulty we are defined
When we're blind we will feel our true selves change
In the sea of difficulty we leave our comfort behind

We are found in far away places, when all seems lost
We are found in far away places, not all is lost

We must be strong and cling onto hope (Cling onto hope)
We must be strong, when the ground is shifting out from under our feet

We are found in far away places when all seems lost
We are found in far away places when all seems lost

Stop majoring in the minors
It's when you get inside that is widens
Stay true tempered (Stay true tempered)
You're not the first to find life is tough

Circumstantial hope isn't really hope
It's just a watered down distraction from what stands in our way
Hope gives us the ability to face reality
The ability to see through it all

Don't mask your pride with humility
While forcing others to keep proving their loyalty

You've been a hypocrite for years
Drawing swords as much as you draw their tears
Demand what you will never deserve
Respect is gained by trust shown and earned

You build your strength off of your anger
Fighting a selfish battle with no answer
Your transparency has started showing
Don't let fear guide you where you are going

You would die for everyone else
But you won't live for yourself

Do you mean what you say?
Do you say what you mean
Or will you find another lie
Another lie to hide behind?
Keep speaking to the world about
What you can't forget
You can't forget all the things you hold onto
Refusing to forgive those that hurt you

You're taking steps on a fine line
So you don't have to choose a side
Good deeds are not recognized
When the heart's intent is full of pride

You're taking steps on a fine line

We were more than friends before the story ends
And I will take what’s mine, create what God would never design

Our love had been so strong for far too long
I was weak with fear that something would go wrong
Before the possibilities came true
I took all possibility from you.

I almost laughed myself to tears
Conjuring her deepest fears
(Come here, you fucking bitch)

Must have stabbed her fifty fucking times

Ripped her heart out right before her eyes
Eyes over easy
Eat it, eat it, eat it

She was never this good in bed even when she was sleeping
Now she’s just so perfect I’ve never been quite so fucking deep in

It goes on and on and on
And I can keep you looking young and preserved forever
With a fountain to spray on your youth whenever

Cause I really always knew that my little crime would be cold
That’s why I got a heater for your thighs
And I know, I know it’s not your time, but bye-bye
And a word to the wise when the fire dies
You think it’s over but it’s just begun
But baby don’t cry.

Cause everybody’s gotta die sometime

Are occurring the likes of which I’d never heard

To repossess a body with which I misbehaved

Smiling right from ear to ear
Almost laughed herself to tears

Must have stabbed him fifty fucking times

Ripped his heart out right before his eyes
Eyes over easy
Eat it, eat it, eat it

Now that it’s done, I realize the error of my ways
I must return back to apologize from somewhere far beyond the grave

I gotta make up for what I’ve done
Cause I was all up in a piece of Heaven
While you burned in hell, no peace forever

Cause I really always knew that my little crime would be cold

I gave in, to selfish ways
And how I miss someone to hold
When hope begins to fade.

A lonely road, crossed another cold state line
Miles away from those I love, purpose hard to find

Dear God the only thing I ask of you
Is to hold her when I’m not around

Blessings of faith, when I have only a mustard seed
For every hardship in my life
I'll hold Your name and I'll do just fine
All praise are Yours and none are mine
Instruments played by hands that cannot read or recollect one solitary note or line
Yet play in perfect harmony
God whispers into some men's ears,
Well He screams into mine
Speaking, endlessly, all my hopes and fears
Nay, simply I'll reply

Blessings so sweet and divine
None of which I do deserve
For only a humble servant am I
Lowly, I'll wash Your feet
With the tears I've cried

Each joy in my life and each breath in my lungs
Attests to Your overwhelming grace
Show us Your love
You see my tattered shoes, my broken spirit
Unequipped to finish the race I could have never won
So You snatched me up into Your strong arms
And over Your shoulders, I was slung
Lord, You've given me the tools to live as Your own
Talent, drive, and the willingness to run
All praise are Yours and none are mine

Blessings so sweet and divine
None of which I do deserve
For only a humble servant, am I
Hope my humility can outlast my pride

271,"If They're Not Counted, Count Me Out",Being As An Ocean,"There is such hope in the stories we've been told
Recounted endless times by the aging and old
Tales of peace, worship and holy places
Palaces adorned with gold and lofty terraces
But I'm always left with quiet dismay
Cause I'm told that some of those I love won't be with me
So I'm left behind in an eternal place
Cause the ones who meant the most didn't receive Your grace
They called it beautiful, but to me it holds nothing that is holy
I can only know what I've seen
And what I've seen is that You've made us clean
Given us the right to be anything we want to be
Why would You give me eyes to see and then deny me these?
Eternity is a lock found inside our hearts and You've handed Humanity the key
So I won't be swayed by fantasies of unquenchable flames
Or some place of torment, the damned never to see Your face
We are all Your creation
You love us all the same
A Father doesn't sit idly by while His children are maimed
I've seen true Grace
I promise you we will never feel the lick of those flames
Where Death is your glory?
Where Death is your sting?
For we are all children of the King
Every last one an eternal being
So I'll reject your fear and hatred
For I bring Good News that will be for all nations!
I've seen wholeness in the broken
I've seen health in the sick
Why do we stifle the Word You've spoken?
If it kills me, I'll tear these walls down brick by brick
I've seen hospitality in the homeless
I've seen Light in the darkness
And I've seen hope in the damned
So if all that has meant the most to me isn't present after my last breath
Count me with the fallen sheep and send me to the depths

272,It's Really Not As Complicated As You're Making It Out to Be,Being As An Ocean,"I do dimly perceive that while everything around me is ever-changing, ever-dying there is, underlying all that change, a living power that is changeless, that holds all together, that creates, dissolves, and recreates.
That informing power or spirit is God, and since nothing else that I see merely through the senses can or will persist, He alone is.
And is this power benevolent or malevolent?
I see it as purely benevolent.
For I can see, that in the midst of death, Life persists, in the midst of untruth, Truth persists, in the midst of darkness, Light persists.
Hence I gather, that God is Life, Truth, Light, He is Love.
He is the supreme good.
But He is no god who merely satisfies the intellect, if He ever does.
God to be God must rule the heart and transform it.
He must express Himself in every smallest act of His votary.
It is proved not by extraneous evidence, but in the transformed conduct and character of those who have felt the real presence of God within.
To reject this evidence is to deny oneself.
This realization is preceded by an immovable faith.
He who would, in his own person, test the fact of God's presence can do so by a living faith, and since faith itself cannot be proved by extraneous evidence, the safest course is to believe in...; the law of Truth and Love.
Exercise of faith will be the safest where there is a clear determination summarily to reject all that is contrary to Truth and Love.
I confess that I have no argument to convince through reason, faith transcends reason.
All that I can advise is not to attempt the impossible.

273,"Nothing, Save the Power They're Given",Being As An Ocean,"These words might mean nothing
But it's a chance I'm willing to take
Cause maybe I'm wrong and lives can change
I'm singing out of my insecurity
So someone, somewhere might be impacted by what I've made
I fidget and sway back and forth
Biting my nails down until they bleed
There is a lie that I've believed
I'd tell you, but I'm so scared of what you'd think
So I apologize if I've caused you to wake
Just close your eyes and let the beat rock you back to sleep
I'll tell you in the morning
About how this man you see
Often times feels like a child
Self-conscious and weak
I'll still put pen to paper
Try to explain these things
That invade my thoughts in my waking hours
Stories of Kings and princes that have lost their way
God, we'd give anything just to feel safe
Deep down, we all know our worth
We just need someone to truly love us first
So we tip toe around these crowded rooms
Hoping someone in attendance might be able to dress our wounds
We cry without uttering a single word
So gather close, circle round
Cause maybe you've just never heard
And I'll tell you the story of the Love I've found
About the Truth embedded in you long before your birth
I'll ask once more
What are these words worth?

274,Salute E Vita,Being As An Ocean,"Raise your glass high
And share with me in my joys and grievings
I toast to the mountains and valleys
To the future and the days gone by
I invite you in with good humor and levity
All I have is yours and I pray that you drink deeply
My cup has been emptied
So I may see what it tastes like to be free
Cause for so long this glass has owned me
Focused on the chalice rather than what it contained
So I gave all of worth to the needy and the rest to the sea
Then I looked around at all of the beautiful things that I had gained
What can a glass speak of its contents
And can it boast at its filling?
What else could it do but mutter a quiet thanks
So it is that I look forward to my spillings
For I am sure that such times are the only thing steadying my hands from their violent shaking
So with gladness in my heart and hope in my eyes
I drink to my fill of Your celebration wine
And as I pour glass after glass
I'll lift it high
(I'll lift You high)
And give a hearty toast to life

275,The Hardest Part Is Forgetting Those You Swore You Would Never Forget,Being As An Ocean,"There sit two lovers
One's eyes intently chasing the other's
She doesn't love him anymore
But he'll stick it out till the end
This he had sworn
Lying awake in bed
Feeling the spot on my chest
Where you used to rest your head
You see love's a funny thing the way it lingers in the mind
No matter what you do or the passing of time
That ember still glows for those lovers behind
No matter if it's well remembered
That light still shines
Good times take precedent over every incident
No matter how poorly spent
So we put on these ridiculous fronts
Like we were just fooling around
Our love was only childish fun
Yet we know different
That it meant something to us
And that piece still lingers in each one that we've loved
So we pick up the pieces
Try and make a half a whole
But in the back of our minds
There's quite a different story to be told
That Love has kissed our lips
That Love has touched our eyes
And no matter how sincere
Love has changed our lives
And even if all love has flown
We'll have a few scars to proudly show
Cause at the end of our lives
We can say, 'At least we tried'
Lying awake in bed
Feeling the spot on my chest
Where you used to rest your head

276,The Sea Always Seems to Put Me At Ease,Being As An Ocean,"You are the topic of every epic we have ever been told
And as I stand on this cliff, the wind whips through me and I am made bold
Once again, Your presence creeps into my consciousness
Grace made tangible in this newly anointed place
And I am brought to my clear senses
That none of my perceived failings or disgrace
Has ever touched my being or inheritance
I am whole, I am clean, I am free
And I brought to my knees
Sink in; permeate this weary flesh
Breathe; life as clean and fresh
As the salt-seasoned breeze
Please Father, pull me to my feet

'Why are you kneeling, my son?
I put strength in that back-bone
Knowing that you would fall
But I promise, you will never taste defeat
You are whole, you are clean, you are free
Get up, rise from your knees!'

We can no longer linger in the shadows of our shame and brokenness
For as sure as the wind blows
He has already redeemed all of this
Live as whole, live as clean, live as free
Everything you were made to be
Standing at the edge of self-discovery
Tired and weary
Our body trembles, buckles
We are afraid of being hurt again
Been stabbed in the back by our own friends
We don't know if we can mend
Minds riddled with unsuccessful recoveries
We're scared
Lord, we're terrified
But dive in we must
Cause there has to be something better than this
For we see testimony of You in the sea
Your creation, all of nature
So with a sudden rush
We abandon our solitary perching place
And as we wash away the mourning dust
Immersed; we see Your face

277,This Loneliness Won't Be the Death of Me,Being As An Ocean,"I swear this isn't the end
But I still feel so alone
Even when I'm surrounded by my best friends
Word's can't penetrate
A tree in the wind
I bend
Falling faster into the depths
I'm falling, I'm falling
Under such depression, I can barely even catch my breath
Words can't mend and love does not sink in
Why can't I see Your face?

Clawing at my chest
Looking for some sort of reprieve
I swear this isn't the end
But when will I feel comfortable in my own skin?

Knowing fundamental truth
Doesn't seem to matter
After such tremendous abuse
Cause I've worked this ground since my youth
And still, the land has yet to bare any sort of fruit
I'll continue to toil and plow
Hoping one day I'll make You proud
'What have a got to show?'
As I wipe the sweat from my brow

So tired, so tired of showing Love so deep
That most aren't even willing to feel
See what I've seen
Open your eyes and recognize that this is real
This season brings darkness so profound
I've become lost and can't seem to be found
Contorted, racked with pain
I know should feel free, yet I continue to sing this sad refrain
I can't sleep and food has lost its taste
God, I'm so sick of this place

Then I'm touched
By the hands of a brother
And like a rush
Passing through my exterior
I hear my name
A hush
A son, loved by a Father
I've been made alive again

278,This Room Is Alive,Being As An Ocean,"This room's alive
Breathing
In this moment, each one of us is leaving
All of life's worries and troubles far behind
Speaking in tongues
Sweating blood
Rapture
Some people search their entire lives for such a cure
Screaming silently inside
Past horrors plaguing their minds
This is our release
This is our violent plea
Hearts scarred and bandaged
Souls weathered and damaged
This is our release
Our violent plea
It's time to burn the past
Take off our self-fabricated coping masks
We'll let each other see who we really are
With our broken limbs and battle scars
Naked, all things stripped away
You'll see we've all gone through similar pains
And like children, we count and play our hiding games
But we won't come inside when Grace calls our name
Slaves to our guilt and shame
Pointing the finger at the one who was never really to blame
Ourselves
Reopen your wounds anew
And watch the broken come to stand by you
You don't have to feel alone
Cause I know this place could feel like home
There is no need to run and hide
When your true family is standing by your side

279,We Will Never Be the Same,Being As An Ocean,"Let the Kingdom fall on this place
Those who have never felt Your love
Feel Your warm embrace
We will proclaim Your continuing creation
Made evident by our many reconciliations
The blind will see
The deaf will hear
Loving with every ounce of our being
We are made whole as we draw near
We will see Your purpose brought about on this earth
Men, made giants out of pain and dirt
Those of us brought up in broken homes
Don't have to fear, we will be made whole
This world we used to view as broken
Is truly a masterpiece in progress
Set in motion by the Words that were spoken
We can choose to stay on the wayside
And watch others grow, while our spirits die
Or we can pick up our tools and chisel away at this life
Revealing a perfect plan
This world is not past redeeming
Creating perfection will take quiet patience
And a love that's endearing
We will not stray
We will not tarry
And in the end, we'll see all unbelief dead and buried
The blind will see
The deaf will hear
Loving with every ounce of our being
We are made whole as we draw near
No one will leave this room sick
Cause You are especially fond of All
And we have faith that You can do this
We have faith

280,Even the Dead Have Their Tasks,Being As An Ocean,"We pack up our gear
And we're gone again
Driven by passion, outward
Away from family and friends
But what they can't see
Is that every day I'm drowning in a sea
Of faces that I miss so desperately
With each flashing countenance
A torrent of emotion, joy, and memories
The people I've grown to love so deeply
Throughout the years
I've chosen a big family
And the weight of their absence
Has brought me more than once to tears
I wake from sleep violently
Only to witness those lives and faces
Disappear slowly behind me
(I'm drowning)
Again I'm pulled back into deep waters
Washed further away from my sisters and brothers
Am I truly living a dream
When the only time I spend with you is in my sleep?

How am I to stay the course, to remain bold
When all those my heart longs for
Remain firmly anchored at home
Am I truly living a dream
When the only time I spend with you is in my sleep?

With every ""it's-been-awhile"" embrace
I wish it could last an eternity
Silently praying for the courage to say
""Oh G-d, how I've missed you!
I've seen you in my sleep!
We were laughing, crying, joking
You know, the way it used to be
Back when we younger and all that much more free
I just hope you see that nothing's changed between you and me
No matter the time we've spent apart
I know it's not always easy to show it
But please believe that I carried you in my heart
That you were with me through every mile
I could have sworn I saw your phantom standing in the aisle!""

It seems you already know what I'm thinking
And that, even after all this time
Some things still do go without saying

We savored the taste of our sweet youth
And now, with calloused hands, gather the remaining fruit
To go any farther, we must endure further pains
Skinned, mashed, and finally strained
Fermenting in the time spent away
Only to return with a fine vintage
To cheers to the health of those who stayed

281,"Grace, Teach Us What We Lack",Being As An Ocean,"Here I stand
High strung and alone
In the court of your Lord's most forgotten son
Tell me witness, what's the difference between addiction to truth and conviction?

The difference must lie in the actions
Spread across a person's life
Did it prove to be obsession?
Compelled to condemn what they don't agree with
Endlessly driven toward the ""right""
A creeping sickness afflicting the others' lives

With proclamations of derision and disgrace
Instead of offering an alternate way
You shot us in the foot before we'd even begun to race!
Conviction stands as a guiding rudder
Through this world's turbulence, storms, and thunder
The helm turns according the movements of our hearts
(This vessel dives and darts)

See conviction wells up inside, an imprint from above
Seeks to reject injustice and not to judge
Works to fix the things that are broken
Walks in humble regard to their fellow man
And never forgets that the greatest law is Love

The difference must lie in the actions
(Was it out of Love or hate?)
Did it prove to be obsession?
(Looking at the walls you've made)

When I fell down there was no regret
Just that lack of laughter, plus my newfound debt
Be it freedom or a shortened spine,
Us broken heathens have learned to lie to ourselves

282,L'exquisite Douleur,Being As An Ocean,"Well I can't get too close without wanting all of you
So I'll settle right into this back seat

It's been a long time running
Since I sighted my first love
And this mountainside's only getting steeper
My breath's burning in my lungs
I wonder when I'm gonna catch a break
or at least be able to breathe easier
This drive is telling me to be all that I can't for her
You're not holding up your end of the bargain,
but I'll continue to hold up mine
'Cause I've always been a betting man
And I'm dying for you to prove me right
I see the potential you have inside
Maybe that's why I've continued to fight
You just can't see all that you are to me
So I'll just have to learn to be alright
Without you by my side
My bed seems so much colder at night
This chill doesn't seem to be going away
So I'll acquire a taste for its bite

Give these dry lips words to speak
A wandering soul, hopeful for living springs
Searching tirelessly for a well, blue and deep
From which to pull up strength, something cool to drink
There are deserts hidden deep inside you and me
Come now, sit for a while and breathe
You don't have to say a thing
Darling, your silence says everything

You're not holding up your end of the bargain,
but I'll continue to hold up mine
'Cause I've always been a betting man
And I'm just dying for you to prove me right

I just want to know your story
Learning, so I may love you complete
'Cause if we dig deep enough
There are wells hidden deep inside of you and me

'Cause I've always been a betting man

283,Mediocre Shakespeare,Being As An Ocean,"How did I let this happen?
Let myself slip back into the role of victim
Thought I'd left that all ""way-back-when""
While forgetting Grace, I increased my own tragedy

Fallen back into the ""how-could-this-have-happened-to-me's""
Like some melancholy play
That no one paid to see
I'm directing on anyway

It seems we have this sickness
A misconception, if you will
That once we've triumphed over something
It lays in the dust, eternal, never to breathe again
But that's not the way this works
Reflections of what haunt us
Will take on new forms in the end
The likes of which we'd not yet seen
How quickly our hearts fill with dread
Yeah, it rains on the righteous as well as the wicked
But some afflictions can feel like death

I've fallen back into the ""how-could-this-have-happened-to-me's""
Like some melancholy play
That no one paid to see
I'm directing on anyway

We either fight or flee
Which one's it gonna be
Realize it's an old demon in a new disguise
I hope you stand up tall to face him
Pray you have the strength to look him in his eyes
Scream loud in proclamation
""I've seen your kind before
G-d, I let the signs fly right on by
Waited till my spirit was laid low
But now my eyes are open wide
This time I see right through your lies
You've tried to put me in the ground before
Extinguish my light
I've got the scars to show for it
But what was once a reminder of death, is now an affirmation of life
Because I took the worst you threw at me and, damn it, I survived.
So get behind me, devil
I refuse to let myself be bound
I won't adhere to mental slavery
Even while your torments abound
Depart from me!""

I swear there's a strength inside you
A faint whisper calling you to be brave
And the next time it seems the darkest
Like you couldn't possibly be saved
Stripped of all comfort and weak
I hope you face your adversary
And find you're stronger than you think

284,Mothers,Being As An Ocean,"A nine-year drought
Brought torrents in May
You had chosen what to call me

Always the strong one

Broken mother, broken father
It was your example that made Grace fully tangible
Looking at your mistakes showed me what risks to take

Working hard to make ends meet
No matter what, please know you did well by me
Forever humble and first to forgive
Treating the other as family
Never forgetting where you've been
You showed us what it means to wholly live

Adorned with quiet strength
You proved that meek doesn't have to mean weak
Learned to show Love to all, no matter title or rank
While not your own, you've helped raise me
And for the things you've shown me
I could hardly offer sufficient thanks
Even as the sickness lingers in your blood
You've carried on in hope and Love
And even though trouble surrounds all the while
You've continued to greet all with a heavenly smile

We watched your body fade
But until the end, your spirit shown bright
Something that cancer could never take away
We laid hands on and prayed
Oh G-d, how steadfast you stayed
How I wish I had possessed such faith
Now we feel the weight of your absence
And it's raised some doubt and questions
But in memorial we'll press on
Because, in the end, it's all you ever wanted for your sons
That we might realize our dreams
Live life beautifully
To truly glean all we can from our youth
Letting the rest of our lives stand as proof
There is a point to all of this
To learn to love as you

I've wounded another human being
These hands were made to heal
But they've only added to the misery

A distant memory, and the warmth of home
What are we then to do?
'Cause in the heat of bliss, we swore we would never love another
There was truth and dignity in that oath
Can there be any hope for their retention, in its breaking?
That even while being disavowed, we recognize humanity
We have all made mistakes,
And G-d, I've made mistakes

In our smallest actions; our greatest fears
Daring all who would come near to break the tension
To incidentally mention the demons you’ve been battling
Regret and shame leaking through every expression
Unable to forgive ourselves for things we could have stopped from happening

And it seems we’ve been thrown into an endless cycle
Of pain and suffering
But if we learn to let go
We don’t have to play out this tragedy
Forgive the things you hate in yourself
So that you might be grace to someone else

We’ve turned to others, searching for some kind of safety
Only to get caught in someone else’s insecurities
Realizing our own humanity we accept shortcomings
Simply natural side effects; fallible being
Forgive the things that you hate in yourself
So that you might be grace to someone else
And in the end, find that it’s you who has been freed

Forgive the things you hate in yourself

All I ever wanted was you here with me

I’m not the only victim of stubborn, foolish pride
I’m not the only one who has something bad to hide

Just let them drift through your mind
Like beautiful clouds
Across a clear blue sky

Just through your mind and away from you
Through your mind and away
As you relax
Deeper, deeper and deeper relax

Just let go of stress and tension
Let go of worry and doubt and relax

Imagine a staircase standing in front of you
With ten, wide, safe, stairs
Down, down to perfect relaxation
Down to peace and contentment
Down towards the happiness that you deserve

And as I count down from ten
Take one step with each number
One step down

Chase that rabbit down the hole.

Wander through the open door that leads to nowhere.
Who's gonna take away my pain, take away my pain.
Before you know you're trapped inside the spiders web,
Screaming there is no escape, there is no escape.

You're the one he chose.
Until the day your bitten by the rabbit down the hole.

She’s acting the role and dressing the part, pretending to be bored
The truth about conformity, is it bites without a sting
Trends come and go, but when your alone it doesn’t mean a thing

Gave them a right to…; ostracize
Out of the woodwork…; art aficionados
Answer one question…;

With the thrill of a kill vengefully the engine will
Roar forth steer the dead leave forced
Driven by fear shift gears veer towards
The foolishly equipped swift these
Failed bids breathed taillights from the crypt
Reflect upon the way beyond redemption
Let the necronometer beckon for the destined
Blessed when first lent sin then condemned to bear the burden
Of this curse the consequence of which can never be averted
Each tormented attempt that is made in vain
To evade this debt which is certain to be paid
Without question is met with a counterclocked surge
In reverse as if backmasked words of the black mass were
All heard by a clutch engaged
Over trails blazed to the western gates

Heaven may be running on empty yet the devil rides
Heaven may be running on empty yet the devil rides
Heaven may be running on empty yet the devil rides
Hell burns by angel turns her pillow to the cooler side

Idle hands are bound for the
Damned once sam went down to georgia
Speed was forged of the divine salt
Mined from the vaults of flame by the lost
Named as those sought as fault rests beneath
The wrong that was spawned from the tired screech
Of essence halted engulfed in the scent of exhaustion
A false witness with the sensed end is brought
To bended knees when abandoned belief in
The mephistophelian plea for wicked unleashed sends
Heed to reap grim an infernally decreed
Reposession vested in the fallen called on to retrieve
Meed with the fueled intention of deprived intervention
The thundered calm that comes from the rattle of descension
Numbs the panicked from a havoc that reeks of oil
Barreling down this mortal coil

When the rivers freeze and summer ends

To keep her from the howling winds

Please see if her hair hangs long
If it rolls and flows all down her breast
Please see from me if her hair is hanging long
For that's the way I remember her best

I'm wondering if she remembers me at all
So many times I've thought and prayed
In the darkness of my night
And the brightness of my days

a day that will live on in infamy.
President Kennedy was a-ridin' high,
good day to be livin' and a good day to die,
being led to the slaughter like a sacrificial lamb.
He said, ""Wait a minute, boys, you know who I am?""
""Of course we do, we know who you are!""
Then they blew off his head while he was still in the car.

Shot down like a dog in broad daylight,
was a matter of timing and the timing was right.
You got unpaid debts, we've come to collect.
We're gonna kill you with hatred, without any respect.
We'll mock you and shock you and we'll put it in your face.
We've already got someone here
to take your place.

The day they blew out the brains of the king,
thousands were watching, no one saw a thing.
It happened so quickly, so quick, by surprise,
right there in front of everyone's eyes.
Greatest magic trick ever under the sun,
perfectly executed, skillfully done.
Wolfman, oh, Wolfman, oh, Wolfman, howl.
Rub-a-dub-dub, it's a murder most foul.

Hush, little children, you'll understand
The Beatles are comin', they're gonna hold your hand.
Slide down the banister, go get your coat,
ferry 'cross the Mersey and go for the throat.

There's three bums comin' all dressed in rags,
pick up the pieces and lower the flags.
I'm goin' to Woodstock, it's the Aquarian Age.
Then I'll go over to Altamont and sit near the stage.

Put your head out the window, let the good times roll.
There's a party going on behind the grassy knoll.
Stack up the bricks, pour the cement.
Don't say Dallas don't love you, Mr. President.

Put your foot in the tank and then step on the gas,
try to make it to the triple underpass.
Blackface singer, whiteface clown,
better not show your faces after the sun goes down.
Up in the red-light district, they've got cop on the beat
living in a nightmare on Elm Street.

When you're down on Deep Ellum,
put your money in your shoe.
Don't ask what your country can do for you.
Cash on the barrelhead, money to burn,
Dealey Plaza, make a left-hand turn.

I'm going down to the crossroads, gonna flag a ride,
the place where faith, hope, and charity died.
Shoot him while he runs, boy, shoot him while you can,
see if you can shoot the invisible man.
Goodbye, Charlie! Goodbye, Uncle Sam!
Frankly, Miss Scarlett, I don't give a damn.

Ask Oswald and Ruby, they oughta know.
""Shut your mouth,"" said a wise old owl.

Tommy, can you hear me? I'm the Acid Queen.
I'm riding in a long, black Lincoln limousine,
ridin' in the back seat next to my wife,
headed straight on into the afterlife.
I'm leaning to the left, I got my head in her lap.
Hold on, I've been led into some kind of a trap
where we ask no quarter and no quarter do we give.
We're right down the street
from the street where you live.

They mutilated his body and they took out his brain.
What more could they do? They piled on the pain.
But his soul was not there where it was supposed to be at.
For the last fifty years, they've been searchin' for that.
Freedom, oh, freedom, freedom over me,
I hate to tell you, mister, but only dead men are free.
Send me some lovin', then tell me no lie.
Throw the gun in the gutter and walk on by.

Wake up, little Susie, let's go for a drive,
cross the Trinity River, let's keep hope alive.
Turn the radio on, don't touch the dials,
Parkland Hospital, only six more miles.
You got me dizzy, Miss Lizzy, you filled me with lead.
That magic bullet of yours has gone to my head.

I'm just a patsy like Patsy Cline,
never shot anyone from in front or behind.
I've blood in my eye, got blood in my ear,
I'm never gonna make it to the new frontier.

Zapruder's film I seen night before,
seen it thirty-three times, maybe more.
It's vile and deceitful, it's cruel and it's mean,
ugliest thing that you ever have seen.

They killed him once and they killed him twice,
killed him like a human sacrifice.
The day that they killed him, someone said to me,
""Son, the age of the Antichrist has just only begun.""

Air Force One comin' in through the gate,
Johnson sworn in at 2:38.
Let me know when you decide to throw in the towel.
It is what it is, and it's murder most foul.

I said the soul of a nation been torn away
and it's beginning to go into a slow decay
and that it's thirty-six hours past Judgment Day.

A victim still lying in bed, completely motionless
A hand moves in the dark to a zipper
Hear a boy bracing tight against sheets barely whisper
This is so messed up

Upon arrival, the guests had all stared
Dripping wet and clearly depressed, he’d headed straight for the stairs
No longer cool, but a boy in a stitch
Unprepared for a life full of lies and failing relationships

She fakes a smile and presses her hips into his

He’s holding back from telling her exactly what it really feels…; like

She’s moving way too fast and all he wanted was to hold her
Nothing that he tells her’s really having an effect
He whispers that he loves her but she’s probably only looking for s…;

Wasting words on lower cases and capitals

I contemplate the day we wed
Your friends are boring me to death
Your veil is ruined in the rain
By then it’s you I can do without
There’s nothing new to talk about

Their parents let them shoulder all the blame

And his chest is all swelled like he’s proud and happy
Like he’s got a great idea
Like he’s makin’ a memory

And come out to the car
There’s an east swell comin’
And it’s howlin’ offshore

And we lighten the mood

What sending a kid to fight can really do
And now with the war, I can tell they’re a little shook up
’Cause just a few mothers’ sons will never really be enough
Not till half of our names are etched out in the wall
And the other half ruined from the things we saw

Get your petals out and lay them in the aisle
Pretend
Your garden grow, and it’s your day to wed

We found your man
He’s drinking up, he’s all-American
And he’ll drive
He’s volunteered with grace to end your life

We’ll tidy up
It’s sad to hold, but leave your shell to us
You explode
You firefly, you tiny boat, with oars

Feather oars
The world tilts back and pours and pours and so
You satellite
You tidal wave, you’re a big surprise

And I’ve one more night
To be your mother

The signal interrupts
Baby’s frequency not strong enough, remain
In my hands, and smile, we will miss you
But in time you’ll get settled, and we will write

Hey, beauty supreme
Yeah, you were right about me
But can I get myself out from underneath
This guilt that will crush me?

And in the choir
I saw our sad messiah
He was bored and tired of my laments
Said, ""I died for you one time, but never again""

Never again, never again, never again, never again
Never again, never again, never again, never again

Well, I love you so much (Never again)
But do me a favor, baby, don’t reply (Never again)
No, ’cause I can dish it out (Never again)
But I can’t take it (Never again)

Seven loves you so much
But do me a favor, baby, don’t reply

Where you’ve been)

You could never work well with our group
Not with the faults we found
So we fixed you with cement galoshes
And no one can save you now
Unless you have friends among fish
There’ll still be no air to breathe
You could drink up the entire ocean
We’ll still find someone to be everything we know that you’ll never be

It shines so fucking bright, tears roll out of my squinted eyes
This is the cold fire, burning down my little hope
I get up, I walk down the street again, but today I’m just the observer, now I am the seeing
Watching all the zombies, I am scared by their ashamed glances

Their empty faces with these glossy eyes, trying to evade my assessment
I see them dying within, lost on the way, not ready to pay
I walk along, no one holds me back, no one blocks my path

I can read their minds, they have lost their goals, lost their dreams, lost their selves
They don’t know what they are searching for now

Now they feel the consequences of their stiffened way of life, caged in their own prison of lies
Focused on the fading things, now the safety falls to dust
What is the use of all the money now, can you remember your decision?

Tripping over lies and hate, envy and vanity
I wish I could change the order of proceedings, no chance at all

I build a time machine, I will reverse my mistakes, pain fade away!

All these sources of noise are whispering and screaming, tempting and frightening
in the middle of my head, beyond my heart
They try to change my mind into something bad, fighting against them for years
But in the end I still decide on my own, fearing the mistakes,
fearing the responsibility to myself and to my beloved, to my beloved

These photos…
Can’t overlook the flashlights, they are surrounding me, observing all my movements
But finally it’s me who’s crying for my perfect sincerity, crying for my salvation, crying for the respect against for myself
So where is the golden means of all decisions? Don’t even know if there is a right way I could choose

I go down on my knees, I’m yelling at the ground, in the hope of finding some new answers

I close my eyes to stop the time, to forget all this misery
Where am I? where’s the place where the roses still grow?
I can’t hear through these hazy words anymore
Is this the reality or just my perception?
Wait for a sign but you can’t see me, through this blurred visibility
But I can see you, the fear in your face, the fluttering eyelid, you can’t hide, you can’t

I perceive there is a way out
There’s might be a solution that cures the world

Can’t you feel it? can you really see it?
So shout out, Convince me
Step up!
You’re the gunman, I am just the bullet shot from your gun now

405,Deliverance (feat. Patrick Schmid),Breakdown of Sanity,"It was a long way, it took a long time to find a safety like this

I was almost giving up all my hope but in the end the picture in my head surpassed my expectations

A world so perfect, a world so fuckin’ flawless
The search has an end, I don’t need anything else other than this place, a place where I belong
Nothing is grey, even the dark clouds above me shine bright
The ocean so deep, my spirit above
No more questions, only answers
I take a deep breath, close my eyes, reach out my hand and try to stop the time to feel the perfection for longer

The warm, pleasant sunbeams on my face, the sand between my toes and the breeze in my hair
No one can take this moment away from me

Please don’t take me away from this place, please don’t wake me up from the place where I belong

406,Hero,Breakdown of Sanity,"It is the darkest night, stars invisible
The only thing I can feel is your cold fear, your shivering hands, controlling gaze
Fearing the end, awaiting the consequences as long as you are walking this path
In fact you don’t have to fear the fog my friends
And I see, you already know the other side, you know the way out

But the cruel end is etched in your thoughts
Your fantasy, only able to envision the worst
You dream of a hero, helping hand, brave guardian

When you wake up you wish to wake up again
Leaving this place is what you secretly hope for

But in reality you can’t run away, in the end the past will catch you all up
It’s not the case that you weren’t responsible
Take a look at this world, drab and reeking
Look at the dull seas, almost dead inside
Look at the toxic sky, we and the sun, no longer friends
Now there’s no more excuses for walking this path
No more chances for the fucking blind
All this is making you sad, all this is making you scared

The hero is close, he can save you
He’s close to you, so close to you
Reach out your hand, open your eyes
What made you not change your mind for so long?
That’s right, the hero is you

407,Invisible Scars,Breakdown of Sanity,"I hope there is an end of this story

Everywhere I go, everytime I sleep I go around in the circle, again and again
On my way to a better life, with a free heart, a carefree mind
It’s joining me through time and distance, like my fuckin’ shadow

Invisible scars, caused by myself, so deep inside me
I played with the fire in my heart
It has finally caught me
They told me
It’s time for change
The beauty enticed me to risk so many mistakes
Why not, why not?!
The signs were clear, the clouds were here
Who knows, maybe they’re still right, maybe there will be rain again
Maybe I can forget, to forget the sadness
Just another aberration? just a delusion?

So here we go, round 3, and I’m doubtful again
The shadow of the past so dark, making my life look empty
I hope there is an end of this story

Every night I dream of the love I lived twice
Every morning I wake up with memories of things that never happened
Alone in the crowd, maybe already forgotten
I see the time is working against me
I guess I can’t stop this, because it’s stronger than me
Impossible to learn the lesson, as long as my heart won’t listen

The circle holds me back, I am strapped down
Waiting for the day I can break through, the moment I can catch up all the love
Waiting for the day, you aren’t just a dream, no!

408,Scissorhands,Breakdown of Sanity,"I forget my own rules, but I still know the end of the story

What’s happened to the world, what’s happened to my life?
There was a time I felt safe, safe from the drossiness, safe from discomfort
No enemies No lies

Where is my soul, where are my ways, where is my heart
Over years it made me weak, it made me unpredictable
Something came across my way, it changed too many things inside me
Over years it made me weak
I saw your smile
Everything around me seems to glow but everything I touch goes out

I hold your hand, feel your breath, see your smile
I took this gift from life, not knowing what awaits me

Where is my soul, where are my ways, where is my heart
Over years it made me weak

Another step in an unknown direction, how can I be sure, how can I be sure?
Days go by, it seems to grow
It feels still right where I am
I can’t see you anymore, feel you anymore
These voices are pushing me, they want me to fail
I am falling, nothing to lose, nothing to win
How could I be sure, why so sure?

409,The Gift,Breakdown of Sanity,"I was falling for a long time
Almost everything I knew became more fucking worthless
So many promises, so much energy

All I want is silence, all I want is peace, all I want is you
No more reason for searching for what I always expected from life

New direction, new fuckin’ rules
You caught me on my way to my new life
I think it’s time to act selfishly

Memories of a time before distrust and pain
Perhaps a dream, perhaps a trap
But not this time, it’s too different
My pulse is slowing down, my eyes are closed now
And I create a picture in my head, a picture of the time
I draw it with my mind, it’s colourful and bright
It’s no longer waiting, from today it’s arriving
This time I can see the sky, the first time I don’t look back

No more walls, no more lies, I can breathe until after the sundown
My glowing heart, just awakened perfection within reach
My sad memories, you make them look like fading dust
I am the air, I am the ground, nothing can burn me down

I really missed this feeling, now I don’t fear myself anymore
Open mind, open ways, my future turns to light
Hope has come to find me, my real destination
This is the control I was waiting for, it makes me unbreakable
I remember who I am, what i was, what i’ve become

410,The Writer,Breakdown of Sanity,"It’s your turn right now
Let me see your steps, let me feel your hesitation
Nothing ventured, nothing gained
We know the reproach to yourself
All your reflections as an open secret
All your mistakes as a success, your tears as the pitiful disport
Your decisions make us win, follow the guide we gave you

Don’t look upward, there’s nothing above you, your eyes aren’t qualified
Your memory is your future, can you remember your end?
We are your faith and your fear
We are your inspiration and your overload
You’re all equal

This is your reality, your veiled sight
You can never see
You can put the blame on us

I see you try to grow with your scars, but you fail again and again
You can put the blame on us, this is what we expect
This makes your life so much easier, just close your eyes, follow blindly
In your deepest dreams you can see us, in your lonely hours you can feel us

This prison was built for you, you are not ready for the outside
Maybe you will never be, maybe you will never see

Nothing is more constant than change

So why don’t you change within?
Positions won’t change as long as you can’t see the point

’Til then we will keep observing you… sneering

Darkness is surrounding me
There’s no hope, no energy, nobody who cares
I can’t get out of this misery

I see, all I can see
I’m hoping for a new life
I’ll just fade away
And the time can tell me that

I’m face down but no one knows
That I can’t erase it
Do you feel it now?
Do you?!

I try not to hate you
Cause that’s the way I’ve been
So it’s time to payback now

A bloodbath with no sense in it

So finish harassing me
You’re like the perfect murder

You act with no remorse
No empathy at all
But I miss your disease

Miss your disease / it’s your disease
Your game, your rules

This is my system’s failure / self-destructive
A throat cut of consciousness
I’m still suffocating
It was your game, your rules
I never really got a chance to win against your mania
But listen, fuck your trip!

This time you were no crack addict

Anyway, I wish you some peace of mind

Break away from you
I can see the smile on your face
I spent my lifetime
Hope - I’m hoping it would come to me
We covered by a mask

I’m still alive
But without eyes
I’m dying deep within
Try to replace
Change my life
But then I suffocate

I lost the lies
I’ve never realized the fuckin truth
There’s more in this world than I thought to see
You’re nothing better
You can not hide ’cause you won’t change your face
I spent my lifetime
Hope - I’m hoping it would come to me
We covered by a mask

I’m covered by a mask
You won’t forget me

There is nothing I would change
Given a chance to rearrange
I wouldn’t part with a single day, not today

Where is my sunrise?
Where is my horizon to begin again to descry
A new life for some hope
Because hope dies last
Regret till death
Because hope dies last

I can not hide behind a mask of utter satisfaction
I’m feeling all this

You will lose your face!

As one device

But i have learned…;

Here comes the pain
I have expected too much
I’ve learned my lesson about the fellow men
Maybe it was better this fucking way

But now I try again
To realize my fucking dreams
With eyes wide open
I will not break again
It will be better this time

I wonder what you think of me
The day will come you regret it
What you have done to me
I hope the destiny will punish you
For your selfish acts

There’s nothing left for you
There’s nothing you can change

And I smile when I hear this shot

The voice woke me up
But I guess I shouldn’t listen

Can you hear this voice?
It’s fucking killing me

My hands are shaking in the dusk

I can’t control my dreams
You can look away, but you can’t turn a deaf ear
This voice in my head

And try to see behind the walls
The walls of silence

Between day and night

You act without human sanity
You make things unforgiveable
With your fuckin selfish plans
Regardless of the consequences

Close your eyes, so many days gone by
Easy to find what’s wrong, harder to find what’s right

I believe in you, I can show you that
I can see right through all your empty lies

Say goodbye as we dance with the devil tonight
Don’t you dare look at him in the eye
As we dance with the devil tonight

Trembling, crawling across my skin
Feeling your cold dead eyes stealing the life of mine

I believe in you, I can show you that
I can see right through all your empty lies
I won’t last long in this world so wrong

Say goodbye as we dance with the devil tonight

And open your eyes
You would see your own life
Just passin' you by

Nobody wants to talk about it
I guess that's true
But you'll know, yes you will
When your time is through
Saint Peter didn't put you here
For no reason at all
So when it's time to go
Oh brother stand tall

We only got sixty years on the planet
We only got sixty years on the planet
We only got sixty years on the planet
And if you get anymore
You might wish that you hadn't

We only got sixty years on the planet

And broke every promise you ever made
I was an ocean lost in the open
Nothing could take the pain away

So you can throw me to the wolves
Tomorrow I will come back
Leader of the whole pack
Beat me black and blue
Every wound will shape me
Every scar will build my throne

The sticks and the stones that you used to throw
Have built me an empire so don't even try
To cry me a river 'cause I forgive you
You are the reason I still fight

So you can throw me to the wolves

Beat me black and blue

Rebuild all that you've broken and now you know

I play high stakes made crook in a crime wave
Must be something on my face
Yelling that they ought no tell em what they spellin on MySpace dot com
Bold type face rhetoric
You gon' clickety click and get your head split
What the hell you look like on a message board
Discussing whether or not the brother is hard core
I ain't got to prove to any of you
That anything I ever said was is the truth but I'm ready to do it
And do it leisurely, Ant give 10 beats a week
So fuck it I'll put the record how it needs to be
I understand I ain't perfect alright
I been a thugged out nerd all my life
Thank God I ain't got to serve dirt or snatch purses at night
I feed people with the verses I write
And I fill them with my personal strife
Had some of y'all concerned for my life
For what I've had the nerve to recite
I cut my grass grow, bring the serpants to light
Now baby you ain't never heard me I'm tight
And I'm surgical like, with this bitch Jake
You know that shit fuck around and get a closed casket and I'm old fashioned
Trying to figure out how we got from Whipper Whip to this silly bullshit
It's just so tragic
But it ain't impossible to solve
I ain't learned jack shit from Dorian at all
Let me hear you abusing the culture I adore
I'll come across the hall and get involved like this here

I'm just here to play my part, and inbetween scenes got to stay on guard
I ain't way out y'all, you just don't get me dog
You gon fuck around and miss me dog, it ain't my fault
And they love the way I talk
Eyes get real wide when I say my thoughts
I ain't way out y'all, you just don't get me dog
You gon fuck around and miss me dog, it ain't my fault

Tabernacle my hand, expand to the size of a big black granite statue
Divide it by the lightning speed that they can move
It ain't an autograph, do that math I'm a smack you
I like to pull up my pants and lean back too
Organic vegetables, mix em with fast food
I'm Howard Stern meets Howard Zinn
How could you not find a pal in him and get attracted too
I take it back for you when possible
If your hear this then I'm confiding in you
Pop call me, ""Ali what's bothering you
Don't you want to tell your friends you and your father are cool""
""NO."" You got more X's than the Honorable Elijah Muhammed do
But that ain't my problem with you
Truth is your just an impossible dude
You get hostile with fools when their honest with you
I could make me a snide little comment or two
But I don't see what that nonsense would prove
I don't give fake props to the dude or walk around in his shoes
I just do what the Qu'ran says to do and respect him
Now I ain't even here to get clandestine
But best believe I'm a get what's destined
Be it an Escalade or a fixed up F10
It's better than this bus, best friend believe that
I ain't got a free minute to lean back
Spiderman 2 coming out and Faheem need that
Plus I wanna teach him how to read on a Leap Pad
Shining bright, smiling like ""look at me dad! ""
That's the shit that I'm in to I defend to the death
That I'm every bit as gangster as them fools
If I wasn't G I wouldn't flow like this
If you were really a G you wouldn't know I exist, you bitch
(I don't understand what they're sayin'
But little did they know they could get a smack for that, man)
So I'd advise you to shut the fuck up
Silly muhfucka

I'm just here to play my part, and inbetween scenes got to stay on guard
I ain't way out y'all, you just don't get me dog
You gon fuck around and miss me dog, it ain't my fault

I ain't way out y'all, you just don't get me dog
You gon fuck around and miss me dog, it ain't my fault

On a crowded street corner surrounded by people all alone
Pain in the heart, rain in the dark, the womb is glum and bitter
She walks around the corner, it’s like she brought the sun with her
Then everything just brightened up, I couldn’t make this up
My fingers in my eyes as she walked by like I was waking up
And so many words, I couldn’t string a sentence together to bother her
I instantly forgot all my plans and started to follow her

It’s like the sky opened and God handed you directly to me
I know it sounds crazy but so is life, I’m sinking
And feeling like your heart is beating solely for me

Your legs are long and toned, you must be walking home
I love the way your lips move when you’re talking on your phone
Intoxicating, truly due to your impurities
Plague every thought of you while I’m trailing you like you’re security
Lost, we couldn’t know our paths would cross but time knew it
Feet sticking out the window, a opportunity climbing through it
Pain for sale, looking to find a new taker
Chance to speak blown, when you looked at me I looked in the newspaper

Because the sky opened and God handed you directly to me
I know it sounds crazy but so is life, I’m sinking
And feeling like your heart is beating solely for me

I’m miles out of my way, creepy, I want more
Was gonna turn back but you stuck your key in your front door
I’m standing across the street, stars that aligned us to meet
Standing outside with your trash feeling incomplete
My finger aching for your doorbell like a random blog
Instead I lurk outside in the cold like an abandoned dog
Perish the thought, you should cherish the words that I got in my mouth
The only words that can truly explain how I got in your house

Because the sky opened and God handed you directly to me
I know it sounds crazy but so is life, I’m sinking
And feeling like your heart is beating solely for me
Unlikely, impossible, I couldn’t dream to think it
There’s something happening between us you can’t deceive
I’m so in over my head I’ve learned to breathe in it
Your eyes are screaming and you’re saying no baby to me
If there was a way out I think you would’ve taken it
My hands and arms are the only way that you can leave
Face to face for the first time, you feel what I’m feeling
Selfishly no longer breathing because of me

You will be mine
Cause it’s high time
Carnage
Chaos
Endless pain
Will drive you insane

I am nemesis
I give you death
Now you belong to me
Die in agony
Greetings from hell
These are my dying words
Every time I kill
I hope to end this curse

I am the shadow, I am the light
You’re my sacrifice

Killing you is killing me

Won’t mend the heart that’s shattered and shred
Lord knows we tried, lord knows we failed

We fade and fade from kiss to kiss
With everything that lovely is
We’ve both grown cold from fight to fight
Until our love has died

All my dreams are far away
You took my life and gave me hell
Give me back my yesterday
Or should I finally bid farewell

Never give all the heart for love
No effort’s ever good enough
Highs result in lowest lows,
We disavow ’til it clearly shows

A bad hand dealt, too blind with trust
Gave you my all, till all was lost
There ain’t no rose without a thorn
Our love could grow and be reborn
And when you walk away
Then walk away my dear
But when you turn around
I wont be standing here

No tomorrow
No tomorrow

All my dreams are far away
You took my life and gave me hell
Give me back my yesterday

Trade your given time for trash

What self-deceptive way

Straight to the grave

How to behave

But it’s only built to fall

You tell me dreams are made to fail,
Like there is no escape
Prepared to walk
The longest trail
Away from mental rape.
Intimidate me with your lies
I’m paying any price
And when I come to say goodbye,
Can’t look me in the eye

And pressed an ear to your ruby red lips…

""It’s coming to get me"", you whispered.
A button on your dress released itself
And the garment dropped to the floor.
The fussy eunoch had fumbled to cover your exposed shoulders
But you couldn’t reach…

""Look… it wants to kill me!""
Understated, yet petrified…
You were appealing to my better side
Although the devil in me ached for satisfaction.

I dashed to the elevator…
Pressed the arrow and waited.

On my 13th floor balcony in this hollow hotel
I spied on the lobby below.
There’s pandemonium.

Guns are trained… cops in corners.
Cops in visors… lines of shields…
And I swear I caught the eye of the beast.
Wrong.

As my would-be adversory turned from the counter, a dart flew into his forehead.
The guns rattled… the line of shields parted.
There was a distortion of spice like a ball of congealed air rolling at a massive speed…
Scattering bodies as it squeezed through the gap in the closed elevator doors.

1… 2… 3… 4… so slow it must grow angrier by the second…

But what the hell could I do about it?

I woke up.
I’m sorry.
And the radio at my bedside spat out the ever-worsening news:
Satan’s in the White House!

React.
Reboot to the sound of a violent fart at a pretentious dinner party.
Let it pass.
I want to wake up again.

I couldn’t save you, my lovely.
I cannot save myself.

It’s coming to get me…

let you know that for once in my life, I’m truly happy. I’m more than content
with who and where I am. Your oppression has had no effect. I don’t need to
justify my opinion after everything we’ve been through. And year after year, we
give our everything and what we receive in return, I can’t explain with words.
I’m so fucking thankful that I made it to where I am today. (I watched the
world upon your shoulders, and from these heights it’s so far down.)

547,Optimist,Counterparts,"I never asked for anyone to listen, and I never asked for
anyone to take my words to heart. I’ve let myself become a target based on
nothing more than expression. I will not lie to others, and I won’t lie to
myself. If you’re searching for safety you can find it somewhere else, and I
won’t mind. I’ve never seen myself as optimistic, so this should come as no
surprise. No one feels good forever. Not even me. But this doesn’t give us an
excuse to allow ourselves to become useless like the rest. We will turn our
hatred into something to be proud of. We will make life worth living.


",4
548,Pedestal,Counterparts,"I’m looking back on those I once looked up to, and I can’t help
but feel that I’m looking down. Everyone I’ve ever admired has left me with
nothing. Not even a memory. I remember growing up, and yearning to be just like
you. It pains me to admit that I held you in such a high regard, as if my life
would mean nothing without your approval. But now I see the error of my ways.
All that time spent searching for myself in someone else. I think it’s safe to
say that I’ve become everything I wanted to be. And no one can take that from
me. All of my heroes have failed me, but I won’t ever fail myself. I can’t
believe how naive I used to be when I never really needed anyone. All of my
heroes have failed me, but I won’t ever fail myself.


",1
549,Reflection,Counterparts,"I’ve never told this to anyone.
I’ve just tried to move past.
But lately it seems that my insecurities have got the best of me.
And I’m no longer in control.
No one should ever have to feel like this.
To feel like me.
Even though the good I have outweighs the bad,
the bad is what’s leaving me with sleepless nights.
I spend most of my time arguing with my own reflection.
For no apparent reason.
And it may seem as if I have all the answers, but I’m just as lost as you.
I’ve spend the past few years trying to overcome my own misery,
but these sort of things take time, and I’m running out of mine.
So I will pray to a God that isn’t there, to a world that doesn’t hear,
to anyone who will listen,
to keep me from becoming everything I promised myself that I would never be.
I do not deserve this.


",2
550,Sinking,Counterparts,"This is the only thing I have worth holding onto
I have condensed my past to fit the lines on the pages that no one will ever see
But still I fight day after day ’cause this is all I’ve ever wanted my life to be
And I push everything I’ve ever loved away
To keep myself from sinking
To keep myself from sinking
To keep myself from sinking

If I find the bad in everything,
I can never be attached
I’m trying to find a balance
I’m trying to find a way
But every choice I’ve ever made brings me anywhere but home
But I’ve welcomed sacrifice with open arms
And I will never regret my decision
This is the only thing that makes me feel alive

Makes me feel alive

I’ve simply been searching for the right place to rest my head
I’m searching for common ground between all that I am and all that you need me to be
I’ve seen a future and want nothing to do with it
A constant campaign to impress those who never ever cared
I’m struggling but I won’t allow myself to sink

You know where to find me
I keep my composure and assume my place, in front of those who I love most
You’re the reason why we’re here
I’m struggling, but I won’t allow myself to sink
I’m struggling, but I won’t allow myself to sink


",4
551,Thank God,Counterparts,"I want to thank you for never being there. Your absence has
forced me to find my own way. While others are led through life with a
blindfold, I can see clearly, the rain will wash me away. I reject the thought
of a god when all we see is the work of an ill-fated world. I reject a liar’s
cross. Who am I to say what I believe is right for the masses? I just know it’s
right for me. For this I have secured my place in hell, but every day I face is
my own heaven in the making. What do you believe in? What do you think is
right? Centuries have passed, the voice of reason is still being suppressed.
Salvation dances in front of their faces, but they’re too blind to see. I
reject the thought of a God, when all we see is the work of an ill-fated world.
I reject a liar’s cross. Thank you for never being there. Thank God for never
being there.


",2
552,The Constant,Counterparts,"I will graciously accept that my life’s work, whether it be
In the past, the present, or the future will be overshadowed by those around me
With a different definition of ""success."" Though I can’t explain the path I’ve
Chosen, all I know is I’m right where I need to be. And though I’ve turned down
A chance at fame and fortune, I know that there is no greater payment than
This. And I’m so fucking far from the life I’m supposed to lead, and the man
I’m supposed to be and I couldn’t be happier. And I will remain a constant, I
Know where I stand, and I refuse to let their selfishness take control of who I
Am. While I may die poor, at least my life had meaning, there’s more to life
Than living, and I truly feel alive. And I know that when I die, there will be
Others who feel the same way ready to take my place. This is our song of
Protest. I promise you that nothing is slowing us down. While I may die poor,
At least my life had meaning, there’s more to life than living and I truly feel
Alive. And I know that when I die, there will be others who feel the same way
Ready to take my place. I will laugh in the face of those who tell me
Different. Even with both of my feet planted firmly on the ground, I am free to
Move in my own direction. I will remain a constant. I know where I stand.


",5
553,The Disconnect,Counterparts,"All of our lives we’ve been told what to believe. ""Nothing
Is perfect"" so what’s the point of purpose? The line that separates the weak
From us who truly care, is one I don’t intend to cross. The heart of man beats
But only in greedy hands, and it seems that most are still content. Where most
Are comfortable accepting insignificance, we strive to find the effort within.
If you open up your eyes, and open up your mind you will be exposed to a world as
Cold as those who are left to populate it. Two decades spent swallowing lie
After lie has sparked a fire in my heart, and the time has come to spread the
Flame. We can’t continue wasting time, day after day trying to find a new means
Of escape. We do this day after day. And I can’t face the disconnect. I’ll shed
The dead weight and rise. I never thought that I would need to justify a reason
To continue in this life I lead. I fucking hate the world, I fucking hate
Myself. I fucking swore I’d never feel like this.


",1
554,Uncertainty,Counterparts,"Though I look forward to my future, just know I’m scared to
death. After all is said and done, I won’t have a clue what to do next. Will I
struggle to find the answer? Will I take an easy way out? Or will I find the
strength inside to carry on? My greatest fear is amounting to nothing. I
fucking hate the fact that I feel no sense of security. But more importantly, I
hate the fact that I can’t confide in myself. It feels like nothing good will
stay, unless I stay the same. I need to find a way to dissolve the uncertainty.
This is who I am, and this is who I’ll always be. I refuse to be afraid, of
something I don’t know to be true. I need to pick myself back up, I need to
find a way to keep all the worry from head. Before it sends me to an early
grave. I refuse to let fear define me.


",1
555,Compass,Counterparts,"The weight came and went and took my will to live.
Spoiled by defeat, forced to drown in what’s left of me.
That’s when breathing became routine, and I could feel myself fading.
Stranded.
No direction, I am a compass.
Constantly spinning.
Constantly searching for the end.
Never reaching our destination.
But the goal was never when, or where, or who…; It was only you.
I appeared in your arms as if I had been born there.
You promised you’d never let me go.
But I don’t know what to believe anymore.
Affection allowed me to let the light in, the fear made me whole again.
Help me rebuild my broken bones.
Help me regain my sanity.
But with caution always present, our pasts manifest themselves.
And we act as if this is what we deserve.
But I refuse to fail again.
I’d force my ghost to write your name in the flowers on my grave.
I watched the world give up on me.
I used to spend my nights praying for air in my bloodstream, now i long to feel your breath pass through my arteries.
The goal was never when, or where, or who…; It was only you.
I appeared in your arms as if I had been born there.
You promised you’d never let me go.
But I don’t know what to believe anymore.
Fill me with your faith and let me leave.
I’m scratching at my skin to take my mind off the absence we’ve created.
The lines blur together like the veins in my arms.
And I wish I wasn’t so alone, You are the difference between Hell and Home.


",1
556,Cursed,Counterparts,"We ache to be transparent.
We run from the ""open"" arms; the facade of something greater than ourselves.
And we’re left to coexist with infestation.
Our history is cursed: Through the past, present and future.
If they’re created in his image, then his image is disgusting…; and even he can’t wipe you clean.
How can someone see so far ahead, while they’re spending every day on their knees?
Is the view from above really worth the judgement passed?
The fear, the lies, and the manipulation?
A doctrine bathed in ignorance, and written in the blood of the enslaved.
And I have never lost my faith, I just never had any to begin with.
I would sooner die for my sins, then pray for my  forgiveness.
Sew my palms together, and crucify the thoughts in my mind.
Awaiting Armageddon.
Neglecting to exercise the demons in your head.
You’re ""born again,"" but you’re better off dead.
Conversion or a casualty, renounce and save yourself.
Is the view from Heaven really worth all of the judgement passed?
The pestilence that you’ve inflicted, and the souls of all the loved one’s we’ve lost?
We are the sheep that rose against the shepherd, we are the ones you led astray.
Embrace the light in your heart, not the one in the sky.
Saints and sinners rejoice, we will all rot together.


",2
557,Debris,Counterparts,"Everything ends, at least that’s what we hope for.
Plagued by our past and we’re doomed to repeat ourselves.
Afraid of the thoughts that dance in revolutions, and circle the mind like a snare: Binding me, I’m just trying to feel something.
Cold and stale, searching for warmth inside of every promise wasted.
You wrap yourself around me, but I can only sense your presence.
You’re nothing but a carcass.
I’ve never felt more alone than I did on those nights I spent watching you sleep.
You’re the furthest thing from me, and you’ve been there from the start.
An empty shell, you’re vacant and it scares me to death. One by one, I watched them leave me behind like living debris.
Fortunately, I know that I’m not worth it.
Because in my purest form, I was never good enough for anyone.
Why did I think that this time it’d be different?
I came bearing only the beat of my heart and the best of my intentions.
I tried by hardest but I couldn’t make you feel a fucking thing.


",2
558,Decay,Counterparts,"The grave welcomes you with open arms.
Last light escapes, last breath remains.
Circling the body, brushing passed the skin and bone.
It cradles you, your holy manger.
Born into ruin, we feel withdrawal.
Death is your procreator, your predecessor.
From your decay grows a beautiful garden, The stalks caress your failure, and the petals bring you closer to eternity.
Pray for your rebirth.
Pray for your chance to bloom.
The heart starts and stops, the mind disconnects.
As flowers, we grace the earth with our presence.
The tide rises and turns, and we simply expire.

Over-saturated, our lungs fill with the essence of the universe.
Until we feel the gentle kiss of dawn draw the water from our lungs, and we can breathe easy.
Like night and day, we have never met. Aching for one another, we aim for congregation.
You are my prey, you are the martyr.
The blight takes it’s toll and our bodies grow black.
Wilted, we fade away. Rotted from the root, we exchange our stem for legs.
We blossom into our bodies, and the process has been reset.
Welcome to your new home.


",4
559,Ghost,Counterparts,"Born of two; raised by four.
I guess I took it all for granted, and only three remain.
Even though you’re wounded, I know that you’re still here.
I don’t blame you, you just can’t face the change.
We spend our golden years as living ghosts.
Caught in a constant state of purgatory.
We are only burdened by our memories until the day they cease to exist, and we follow shortly after.
Although I wonder if at any time, our minds fell upon the same plane.
I know they did, I just wish I had a chance to go back and appreciate it.
But we’ll always have the winter, and the snow that got trapped behind the glass.
You may be only a shell of the man that you used to be, but I love you just the same, and I will until the day you’re gone.
I just never know if I’m communicating with you or the disease.
And even though I curse the idea of an afterlife, I still hope you’re taken care of.
You deserve to be at peace.
Please don’t forget my face.
I won’t forget to remember you.


",5
560,Lost,Counterparts,"As far back as I can remember, the failure was always there.
It was the only real companion that I have ever had.
Not meant to live like this.
Consciousness is nothing more than a vicious cycle, and I am being bled dry by my conviction.
I’ve spent my life trying to find my confidence, and found absolutely nothing.
Life is a lost cause.
Too weak to carry on.
I wish I’d never met who I once was.
Not meant to live like this.
Pursuing the love in all that I have lost, but I have left myself neglected, deserted from the start.
Longing for a chance to wander; a chance to chase my aspiration.
When you’re devoid of feeling, you just do as your told.
Hatred is exhausting, but it’s all I’ll ever know.


",3
561,Outlier,Counterparts,"I live with the awareness of my own seclusion.
Existence fuelled by separation, A war I will not win.
Embracing only alienation.
To suffer is to abandon the only home I’ve ever had. Outlier.
I don’t belong here.
The present state of existence acts as a refuge for the weak.
To shield our eyes is to blind mankind. Refusal to secede.
Inhabiting a world of filth which others have condemned.
We won’t live our lives for them. Human hatred is my second nature.
This is the root of my isolation. I am what I am, and I am an outcast.
Don’t look for me in the clouds, when I am beneath you.
Nowhere to be found.
Submerged in apathy, it’s just becoming hard to care, and I am nothing.
I have grown sick of the sound of my heartbeat.
And while the whole world breathes in unison.
My lungs are my shield, to reject the world around me.
I am what I am, and I am an outcast.


",1
562,Slave,Counterparts,"If I allow the light to leave my eyes, I will never see again.
The thoughts disintegrate into cognitive pollution.
Abandoning my body, renouncing my existence.
Show me the meaning of happiness.
Trapped inside this nightmare, but I haven’t slept for days.
I am a slave, a slave to what I cannot see.
Are we being strung along or are we just strung out?
The quest to be clairvoyant: You are your own black hole.
How much longer do I really have when I wish every breath would be my last?
Your words like rope, tied around my throat.
Remove the earth beneath me.
Watch my spirit sink.


",5
563,Soil,Counterparts,"Tragedy is all we have in common, and at times we allow it to swallow us whole.
Drawing the marrow from our misfortunes to ignite the fire that’s inside, inhale the smoke from the burn that leaves you breathless.
Breathing life into the lifeless, dragging them into the sun and exposing them as apparitions.
But is there dignity in living as an entity?
""You could have made history, and we are already forgetting about you.""
Humanity is poison, and we are lost without a cure.
So stop your heart and start the healing process.
I am not fit to walk among you, but I don’t want to end my life.
And just know that If I knew of any common ground, I’d leave here now, and when I got there I would build a home that I could die in.
Just to say I tried to rest in peace.
Erase me from your memory.
The ones we love will let us down, and the rats will feed off of our failure.
Eventually, this is something that we must accept.
The world moves on without us.
We leave only footprints that fade away in time.
We leave our spirits to retrace our steps.
Walk with fire, and save yourself from vagrancy.
You are your memorial, find your mark and make it.
The soil is the last thing we ingest, we watch our ashes scatter.
You are your memorial, find your mark and make it.


",4
564,Wither,Counterparts,"I am more than familiar with feeling empty.
The conduit; I allow myself to drain.
My mind is the trench in which I will be buried.
Watch me wither away.
Put me out of my misery.
I can only find solace in sleep, a sub-conscious sanctuary, I am longing to be set free.
Yet I am the one who holds the key.
I am the one who holds the key.
A lifetime spent trying to place the blame on anyone or anything.
This is not who I am.
I am not who I used to be.
Set me free!
Set me free!
Set me free!


",5
565,Witness,Counterparts,"Expose me for all that I am.
The man behind the masquerade, I am my own false witness.
Fact resides solely in the depths of my mind…; and will I ever really let it come to surface?
You only see what I want you to see, and you believe all that you’re told.
Serenity is a beautiful hoax.
A liar.
I have the whole world convinced of my contentment.
No truth in this.
I’ve lost count of all the times I made it home alive…; and wished I hadn’t.
Expose me for all that I am.
The man behind the masquerade, I am my phone false witness.
I’m left to conquer the mountains in my mind, and I am my maker.
Life is what’s killing me.
I hate the fact that I’m just fine.
Forever seeking something to take responsibility.
Life is what’s killing me.
I hate the fact that I’m alive.
Forever searching for my scapegoat because I refuse to face reality.
At least I can say I tried, to cherish every single day where I woke up and didn’t want to die.
I’d work my hands down to the bone trying to stay suspended in those specific seconds.
But I know I’d just be counting down the minutes until I’m miserable again.

566,Six Shooter,Coyote Kisses,"I took a cheap shot,
A clean miss.
Burnin’ my defenses by the shakin of her hips,

And then she
Moves in,
A quick kiss,
Breathing down my neck,
She had me wrapped around her wrist.

I try to
Break loose,
Tight grip,
Knocking me unconscious when she bit her bottom lip.

It was a
Lost cause,
A fast fight,
She ain’t taking any prisoners
And she’s through playing nice.

Loaded the bullets with my blood in the rounds.
Yeah she’s a sweet six shooter,
She knows how to get down.
Until the kick-back,
When my heart hits the ground.

And every minute was a lifetime and the ocean was a sea
And you dragged me into the mountains on a flimsy guarantee

I used to dream of love and kisses wanting to belong
And I tear around the corners blindfolded to the world
I used to think that candyfloss was only made for girls

Do you believe in me?

Hard-headed sense of failure in a narrow mind
I never used to think about the hurt I’d left behind

Punks just jealous ’cause they can’t outwrite me
Or kick that style: wicked, wild
Happy face nigga never seen me smile
Rip that mainframe

A nigga like me is goin’ insane

I got to get my props
Cops
Come and try to snatch my crops
These pigs wanna blow my house down
Head underground
To the next town
They get mad
When they come to raid my pad
And I’m out in the nine deuce Cad’
Yes I’m the pirate pilot
Of this ship if I get
Wit’ the ultraviolet dream
Hide from the red light beam
Now do you believe in the unseen
Look, but don’t make your eyes strain

621,Get It Anyway,Cypress Hill,"I’mma do my thing, let me tell you right now
Cuz I don’t know any other way of livin’ my life now
Some of you know the struggle, some of you live in a bubble
Some of you hustle and some of you just lookin’ for trouble
(some of you just lookin’ for trouble!)
I don’t follow or lead, tomorrow’s a dream
Pray to God to intervine on all the sorrow I’ve seen (U Know I mean?)
You want out of here, you can leave when you wanna
Nothin’ can stop you if that’s your type of persona (Persona!)
Life is short enough don’t make me say it 10 times (10Times!)
I’ll kick over for mine even in the end times (Times)
I can beat the system, come on, let’s say it with me
Show me some optimism, we can take over the city (We can take over the city!)

Real life represent the scams since the first day
Gangstas, hustlas, grindin’ out around the way
Can’t stop gotta be always on the paper chase
Educated, they won’t give it, but I did it anyway

Stay invaders like the battle of forever more

Don’t burn nobody and make the money honestly
Open your home with the internet technology
I get it anyway just by the  economy

622,KUSH,Cypress Hill,"Hey man! Check this out. I got the best KUSH ever man
Aw, man... I’ve been so out... You got sent from heaven
All right, man, light it up, holmes
Ok, check it out man

I’m the original Dr. Greenthumb the rest are liars
I’m the one with the prescription to get you higher
I got every type of weed that you might desire
Go ahead, fire it up, maybe you can get inspired
Any kind of flavor you savor
I can do you the favor
Just as long as you share with your neighbor
Some like the Sour D, that’s an east coast swing
But on the west coast we all know KUSH is queen
Some of y’all will smoke anything, but me, I’m picky
I throw it out if I don’t see that it’s green and sticky
No stress, no bush, I’m pushing the KUSH
When I harvest put a K on the bag like the Nike Swoosh
I’m over the world, in case you wonder
I smoked everywhere I went, they call me the weed hunter
But no one does it better like we do in Cali
Just ask one of my patients cause they always tell me that the...

K.U.S.H. keeps us so high
The K.U.S.H. keeps us so high
The more I smoke, the higher I get
The better I feel, I can’t quit
The more I smoke, the higher I get
The better I feel, I can’t quit

Kottonmouth Kings are down with us
Snoop Dogg and Dre are down with us
Cheech and Chong, they’re down with us
But the DEA, they can get the nuts
On a high times cover, you might see us
Taking hits from the bong with the eight-foot Zong
With weed so strong, that knockout King Kong
Hit it one good time... Your mind’s gone
Your eyes get red, and your mouth goes dry
Just get me when you want more and I’ll supply
Red and meth said, ""let’s gets stoned"" I said ""How High""
They said ""high enough to touch God and kiss the sky""
""That’s a tall order But I think I got what you need""
I got the food for though and I’m ready to feed
So, follow my lead I got some gifts to bring
It’s an everyday life for the Reefer King

K.U.S.H. keeps us so high
The K.U.S.H. keeps us so high
The more I smoke, the higher I get
The better I feel, I can’t quit
The more I smoke, the higher I get
The better I feel, I can’t quit

I got the cream of the crop
My crop means cream
When it’s time to bag it up I assemble the team
We’re like the Yankees, most winning, grand champs of the herb
Nothing gets you like the type of medicine I serve
Lawyers, teachers, actors, street cleaners
No matter what they are, they all come to see the Reefer
They stay high 24 like Keifer
I tell ’em don’t hit too hard, this is a Creepa
Woody Harrelson is down with us
Bruce Willis smokes all, he’s down with us
Yeah, Willie Nelson is down with us
Who the fuck you think drives the ganja bus?
Dionne Warwick, she’s down with us
She got caught at the airport with joints and such
So if anyone asks, she’s down with us
And you don’t wanna enter more weed in the Cannabis cup
I’m Greenthumb, I reign supreme, son
A strain better than mine, I’ve never seen one
The K.U.S.H. keeps you so high that you can’t concentrate
Dave Chapelle, is down with us
Halle Barry, too, but don’t tell no one
KRS-One is down with us
He’s a blunt getting smoked and he can’t wake up

K.U.S.H. keeps us so high
The K.U.S.H. keeps us so high
The more I smoke, the higher I get
The better I feel, I can’t quit
The more I smoke, the higher I get
The better I feel, I can’t quit

I be that, short-temper, hostile rhyme bringer
Lifestyle gone wild, similar to rock singers
Check me on the big screen, livin’ out my dreams
Cypress, Assassins, SX, latin thug thing
Fools think they get bad, I ain’t really with that
Flavour of the month, bro, (?) try to dispatch
Always got the good badge, take it to the head
Got me wasted like Jerry from the Grateful Dead
Don’t trip, get a grip, be strong and don’t fake it
Or else you get beat down, an’ stripped butt-naked
I just kick the lyric, straight from the spirit
You can tell I got soul first time as you hear it

When you deal with the Hill, keep your mouth still
If you rely on your skill then rely on your steel
If you have no ideal, or any thoughts to feel
What you sought was real, to give ’em slots to fill
Busters stop to deal
But I face them, quicker than takin’ a box of pills
Now you gots to chill
Get cops and sheilds, steady, hark the (?)
If they’re lookin’ for prey, ready to stalk and kill
As I lock the wheel, don’t you mock the drill
’Cos I’ll cock my steel, make you drop and spill
Got no mercy unless you talk to deal
Quit talk and kneel, you won’t top my will, bitch!

Ain’t no-body better, on that you can bet (CY-PRESS!)
Wanna see a dope show? Put your money on my set
Real emcees and real DJs
Real South-siders from the heart of LA
Now, back in the day we had big sucess
And it’s like that now and we won’t settle for less
You can beat the LB from the new latin lingo
Nowadays you nothin’, without a hit single
Time to get loco, and put bodies in motion
Hit the stage in a rage, and start up a commotion
No I ain’t jokin, see my mic smokin’?
I slam it like the art and make sure it’s broken

Welcome to the show, all come inside
You can hear proper sound when it’s Amplified
You wanna party with the best and say ""fuck the rest""

624,Bitter,Cypress Hill,"I lost my innocence at birth but I make no excuses
for the trivial things and the pain life induces
Bitches are wild, and so was I, young and stupid
it's incredible, what a shitty circumstance produces them
Criminals, led by the originals, high strung, motivated by the, principles
some of us out - he used to think we were invincible
on the corner bangin' and slangin' the high bitual
Deadly rituals fill my head, nothin' spiritual
Bullets filled up bodies like hands from my physical
I got touched by the hot hands of bitter fools
Divided and tempted snake bitten by the ridicule
Frustration and hate filled my adrenaline
I play doctors here's two bullets for your medicine
I carry those days like a weapon close to me
The memories of hot lead rippin' a hole through me

Son, fill your heater, how bout chase killer
Rock 'em up and show you're no quitter
Snakes' pit every ground I landed on
Hated on, but I'm still standin' strong
You hate the songs that you pump up all day long
Hated on, but I'm still standin' strong
Snakes' pit, every ground I landed on
Hated on, but I'm still standin' strong
Stand…

So many, come and go in this lifetime that you serve
Faces change, liscenses' everywhere you turn
Gangsta's become blinded, visions become blurred
Learned to stay alive to the real side of the curb
You came along way but some still refuse to notice
they turned they back on us and they tried to provoke us
You ask about us, you talk trash about us
walk fast around us, but my block fast allowed us
Don't try to crowd us nigga, we'll smack you up
Look around and see who's willin' to back you up
You're in a ghost town and home alone like Macaulay nigga
don't say my name nigga, don't even think of me
Fire start spittin' from my grill piece, ya scorched up, touched up
I'm the C4 that blew up your porch
I spit venom quicker than the punch on your Porsche
Venom so deadly I'll make your fuckin' life divorce ya
Ask for Alamoney, bitches, you all phoney
I'll make you sing the blues like you're Paulpau Coloney
Go ask Moley, you in the middle of shit
And anything you say I'll be known the shit
The force drops hits a ball, makin' me die of laughter
Cause I know what these son-of-a-bitches are after
Your mind and soul, if your blind and cold
then your true sign is shown, then your fuckin' mind is blown

Son, fill your heater, how bout chase killer
Rock 'em up and show you're no quitter
Snakes' pit every ground I landed on
Hated on, but I'm still standin' strong
You hate the songs that you pump up all day long
Hated on, but we're still standin' strong
Snakes' pit, every ground I landed on
Hated on, but I'm still standin' strong

You got more skulls in your closet than a Kennedy
You on my nuts so you better hold tenderly
I can tell you what’s crackin’ and done get splitten
You corrosin’ on the floor, shaken and snake bitten
You in a cold sweat like James of the names you knew
Don’t mean shit to me and you ain’t got a clue
of what’s about to happen - interaction
Two worlds collide - one survives the reaction
Hold tight, keep yourself together
’cause we’re about to storm you like shitty weather

I can see what you see what you asked for it has to be
You set yourself up for catastrophe

Set yourself up for catastrophe and that’s the only way that is has to be

How can I say: ""You ain’t shit to me""
Without you takin’ it personally

Ten, proper years of bringin’ funk
I, still count mine, it’s hella gettin’ over the hump
I got the loads on the skull, I got my hand on the pump
Still got the boss to go nutty on you punks (yeah!)
I don’t wanna be the King of the Sing
Just a Soul Assassin for the Cypress Team
I rhyme and sing and make bitches scream
They love that old South Side gangsta lean
Call the Psycobeta, I guess you’re crackin’
Turn into Mad Dog when I start rappin’
Look at hostile - ah, damn wild
Shake you up in a hurry from the voodoo child
Don’t get caught up hangin’ on the mortar
Hold on and I’ll turn y’all punks all wild

I’m tired of whack rappers and fame seekers
Like you know the deal to be in my same sneakers
I don’t mind exposin’ you hollow bitches
I got the medicine over the swallow bitches
You play roles like an actor but get no oscar
Gun spray, gunned away, cut from the roster
You’re just an imposter, you lost your composure
Respect your exposure to bring you to your closure
But you’re in denial and still remain vile
In a place within last style and senseless wild
I take you down the long trail you failed to keep up
That’s when you get introduced to the street sweeper

I can see what you see what you asked for it has to be
You set yourself up for catastrophe
I can see what you see what you asked for it has to be
You set yourself up for catastrophe

My life, I realise I’m responsible for obstacles
In front of me, my own self to blame
But I worked hard to receive the wealth and fame
It’s a worthless game, but if you’re willing to play
There’s sharks in the water who are, willing to pay
The price of your soul, but if you give it away
You silly motherfuckers are all commited to stay
It’s a cold world, but you still want a part of it

Put it to the test, and you will confess
Soul Assassins is the best
Check it homeboy, got to spot cracking (crackin)
Six LP, from that Thugged-out Latin
Turn the heat up, and keep it hot
Always give ya mo’, and then thank
We got to freak the Hip Hop and the hot ride

Had first ’self titled’, became an Idol

631,Memories,Cypress Hill,"As I sit in my silver stack thinking about way back
Even before I started blazing the chronic sack
I was a go wild unfocused troublesome kid
Looking up to all the gangsters and the shit they did
I was at unimpressionable age through a faze
An unmentionable stage deranged full of rage
Walking through life in a haze with dark clouds
Hanging over my head being wicked and loud
And sometimes those demons haunt me and taunt me
Follow me pursue me confuse me they want me
They come at me from all angles and dangles
Memories in front of me, but I wont run away
I put the gun away but sometimes my hand ditches
But I don’t want to get locked away cause I whack bitches
I left those ways back in the old days
So go away I don’t got no time to throw away

Memories they haunt me (they haunt me) they follow me
To the day I die (we fight and we struggle out here so we can stay alive)
Memories they haunt me (they haunt me) they follow me
To the day I die (got to do what I got to do out her so I can survive)

I got my education on the streets
And I learned how to spit rhymes out with or without beats
To say whatever I went through or going through
Tripping off people who acting like they been knowin you
Learn how some of these record companies be holdin you
Attaching an image in the end controllin you
But we set out to set ourselves apart
And let these people know just what they had from the start
It’s like Ghostface said we studied our art form
We turned the mike on and spit a fucking dark storm
People slept on me and doubted my skill level
But I’m tenacious and I got a strong will level
You been introduced to some of the real rebels
Injected with venom from god to kill devils

Memories they haunt me (they haunt me) they follow me
To the day I die (we fight and we struggle out here so we can stay alive)
Memories they haunt me (they haunt me) they follow me
To the day I die (got to do what I got to do out her so I can survive)
Memories they haunt me (they haunt me) they follow me
To the day I die (we fight and we struggle out here so we can stay alive)
Memories they haunt me (they haunt me) they follow me
To the day I die (got to do what I got to do out her so I can survive)

I remember my days as youth
Teenage gangsters with somethin to prove
See man amuse and we creep and we strew
Catch your ass slipping and dump on their crew
Just -- having fun but you crazy kids
Never thought about no prison beds
Got gang-sters twenty-five and alive
Never see the kids all fucking wild
But that’s the game and shit don’t change
Get respect for smoking brains
You get a name and you build your rep
You courting fools coming in your set
Before you know we’re having fun
Slamming doping and packing gun
Leaving mad traces and blasting their faces
Got a hundred years for all my fucking cases

Memories they haunt me (they haunt me) they follow me
To the day I die (we fight and we struggle out here so we can stay alive)
Memories they haunt me (they haunt me) they follow me
To the day I die (got to do what I got to do out here so I can survive)
Memories they haunt me (they haunt me) they follow me

Many faces, many places
that I found friends
Places where I spend time, places where my mind roam
Places I can call home
Places I can get stoned
I just wanna be alone
When I’m feelin’ in my zone
People want to knock me down
’cos they never have their own
They won’t get the best of me
But they try hopelessly
Why you wanna fuck wit’ me?
I’m not, what you s’posed to be?
You could not give a DAMN
Coulda just Killed A Man
Sawn off in my hand
But I had to kill the plan
Think I’ve found my piece of mind
Feet planted on the ground
I just had to redefine, what I thought to myself
It all goes around me and others who would down me
Who I don’t give a fuck about, Trouble always found me,
I know used to welcome it with my arms open wide,
Trouble’s hand’s on the door, but it can’t come inside!

No trouble’s at my door!
You want trouble, c’mon,
You want trouble?
You want trouble, c’mon

Trouble on the line, all the fuckin’ time
Got me contemplatin’ the solution, the fusion my wicked mind
Got suckers that hate me but it don’t really matter
I’m like a gat when I bust, niggas run and scatter
Movin’ in circles, throwin’ elbows and fists
You got to be a real nigga in a Cypress Hill pit
Lotta critics talkin’ shit, but I’m not concerned
A hundred G’s for sixty minutes is the bank I earn
I try to put it to you BLUNTLY so you bitches can learn
That no-body get tired when it’s time to burn
With so many phonies out there a lot of you have been fooled
In to actually believin’ that some shit is cool
Take the blinders off and go look for yourself
Fuck hearin’ about shit from somebody else
I’m down for myself, I back up myself
Put in all on the line make sure that I’m felt!

No trouble’s at my door!
You want trouble, c’mon,
You want trouble?
You want trouble, c’mon
You want trouble?

Nooooo!

Look, the wall’s closin’ in
and my shoe’s wearin’ thin
Had to be the biggest clown that you couldn’t comprehend
Some hated on my game, said I wouldn’t be the same
Called me ""Rock Superstar"", ""Insane In The Brain""
But I know I haven’t changed
So I brush you to the side
Trouble’s knockin’ on the door, Anxious jus’ to come inside
’times I gotta block it out, no-one likes to talk it out
Trouble keeps comin’ and I can’t seem to lock it out
Got my hands on the phone, I don’t wanna have to talk
If you’re feelin funky son, then I guess you gotta jump
I can see it in your eyes, you don’t seem to recognise
I wouldn’t fall into your trap, for many lives to compromise
I’m not fallin’ for your shit, you ain’t gonna take me there
You can talk all you want, but I don’t got your weight to bear

No, trouble’s at my door!

642,Moment of Truth,Damageplan,"There were times when I questioned my reasons.
Thought I wouldn’t last.
Seemed the hand of God held my head underwater.
Somehow I fought back.

It’s still not over yet.
No, it won’t let me quit.

Found myself more than just once
Praying down on my knees.
My search for answers only led to more questions.
Sometimes for faith you’ve got to bleed.

By now I’ve bled my share,
Now it’s my turn to redeem.

When it comes my way I won’t be scared,
I’ve been waiting all my life.
Pain has prepared me for the moment of truth,
And the true test this time.

Give all you have because you believe,
Sell your mortal soul.
And if you’re not a predator, then, oh - you better pray.
Bet it all now or fold.

But there’s still a danger there.
Don’t become one of them.

When it comes my way I won’t be scared,
I’ve been waiting all my life.
Pain has prepared me for the moment of truth,
And the true test this time.

For all I’ve done - some good some bad,
Don’t hang me just yet!
Judge me not on one thing I’ve done,
See my whole life instead!

When it comes my way, I won’t be scared,
I’ve been waiting all my life.
Pain has prepared me for the moment of truth,
And the true test this time.

649,New World,Dani Shay,"This is the breakedown.
ha!
try to follow.

inside I'm crying, dying to ask why
We're working for nothng from 9 to 5
I can feel the exhaustion wearing on me
can't face the fact that -
I am not free

freedom is a lie we learned to believe
like a book with no pages we pretend to read
you envy me - let me tell you where I came from
I ran like hell through my imaganation
just to get away from what i did not understand
like how a boy becomes a coward and calls himself a men
and everyone around him pats him on the back
happily obvious ignoring all the facts
knick knack paddi whack give a dog a bone
sit, stay, roll over, run away from home
this is what we teach to the demons we create
avoid your inner conscience,
and hide from your mistakes
then lie awake hunted by your messed up thoughts
contemplating actions afraid of getting caught

this is how we're waiting on the edge
for the problems that haven't happened yet
paranoia is crawling into our head because
this is how we're waiting on the edge

I wonder why we're still falling for the same old tricks
it seems like we're  all broken and need to be fixed
were like robots aboarding the economy that failing anyway
and won't let us be who we wanna be
its sickening a world on the go
I need a triple tall hot latte and a blueberry scone
and for lunch, I'll take number 5
with a large diet coke
and an extra side of fries
and you can feed me lies
I'll eat them up to
at night I pray to god and ask him what to do

this is how wer'e wating on the edge
for the problems that haven't happened yet
paranoia is crawling into our head because
this is how we're waiting on te edge

and millions of children, dying of hunger
we cant see the lightning, cant hear the thunder
we are going under
if things don't change soon
the world will be dead by tomorrow at noon
raped of her glory
raped of her life
raped like the husbands rape their wives
and the wives have also lost their minds
drowning their kids
and feeding them lies…

all in favor of a new world say I
all in favor say I
all in favor of a new world say I
all in favor say I, aye

I don't wanna sit and wait for shit to hit the fan
but you can, if you want
with the family you brought
to the land of all promises
where all you ever wanted was a chance to take a stand
against the world that took your confidence
because you have been on it since
the day you turned ten
and your dad said you have to earn your money to spend
thats what you did - you became part of the system
working to earn a respect of old rich men.
shining their shoes, and pressing their pants
playing their games and dancing their dance
basically home to get a chance -
a chance to get notice, to maybe advance
but, let me let you in on a little secret -
you can package your pride, and tell theme to keep it
because you dont need them. they need you caus' you feed them
you do the work while they sit tall cause you are lucky you have a job at all
right?

this is how we're waiting on the edge
for the problems that haven't happened yet
paranoia is crawling into our head because
this is how we're waiting on the edge

so one more time everybody, alright.

this is how we're waiting on the edge
for the problems that haven't happened yet
paranoia is crawling into our head because
this is how we're waiting on the edge

here we go

all in favor of a new world say I
all in favor say I
all in favor of a new world say I
all in favor say I, aye

650,For Broken Words,Dark Tranquillity,"No truth, no lie
No truth, no lie
No truth, no lie

It twists and turns
Into something that is not to be
What truth is left
What's abandoned as the life flew by
Our words are broken

We commit to our sacrifice
The betrayal of the code
Thrust into nothingness
No truth, no lie
Our words are broken

Our subconscious bias
Confirms what we already believe
There is no message, there is no value
Just the sheltering of false ideas

Tear our thoughts
Into splinters
Set the sense
That's forced to remember
Words get thrown
Out of focus as we
Test our will
Dissolve to nothing
Break all bounds
Of unfair holding
Track this line
To journey's end
We're breaking down

651,Uniformity,Dark Tranquillity,"It all comes out
In desire we forgot to face
Take down ambition
Or in our minds we will always fail

The faceless remember
The Hours and the fallen words
Connect the fallacies
Detect autonomy
There is a limit
To the never ending sky

We must come to terms
Admit we are defeated
We must come to terms
With bias and deception
Stand up and be counted
In uniformity

It sets a high mark
For what our minds can endure

Is there life in the distance
A faint beacon of light
Let us fall to the inner ceiling
Of everything we see

The endless resistance
Decides upon the fallen words
Direct the agony to a non-response
And forgiveness to an idealized mirage

It informs all decisions
And challanges us to dare

Not to care

Don't bring it
Don't bring your misery down on me
Wear misery's crown

As always in these matters
You broke the deal of deals
And wasted what was given
To revel in your mess
I gave up all for nothing
I tried my best and failed
There's a thousand million reasons
Never to share again

This is how it all begins

Lit up by shining faces that parade these streets

You walk the mounds of skull and bones
Where living is denied, I see more movement in decomposition than in those hollow eyes

It is the only place I know, where death is most alive
It is when truth is turned to lie, that death is most alive

Set flame to the ensnarers and pierce that ornate shield
Branded by what claims you, you wear the mark of death
Tear from loss and agony, a character defined
Stripped of all but tragedy, what life is left to find?
Go now, until there's nothing left
Go now, the dying has begun

It is the only place I know, where death is most alive
It is when truth is turned to lie, that death is most alive

So I flee from all that is me to hide behind this pale dead face
Whatever happened to desire, want and need?
Whatever happened to integrity?
Imagination is a curse in all of this
Whatever happened to the ones left behind?

This is a ghost town, our bodies dragged through endless streets
Go now, to never return

And when you sleep, I hear the heart that beats you

Have you come here to warn me of what I cannot see?
You want to tell me something, but you do not have the words

I fought into the distance, a life that does not connect
Time played out its part on the strings that bind us

Encounters in silence, words elude the fading night
Wish I could fathom what is too hard to tell

And maybe I’m weak, but not beneath the covers of this bed.
Asleep, I’m undefeated in this world of mine.
So let me stay inside this dream, and keep me from the light.
I built this place behind my eyes you’ll never see.
And you can move my body, but please keep my mind asleep.
Beyond the galaxies where there’s no space or time.
I will transform, I am reborn to rule over the skies.
I
I feel it in my bones, escape the world I know.
It’s all in my control.
I
Just wanna see this way, blood pumping in my veins.
I feel it. I feel it!

Behind the darkness, there’s a sea of neon lights.
And maybe you think I’m sinking, but you just can’t get inside.
Don’t try to save me when my mind is finally free.
Cause I’d rather run my own world than face your reality.
It’s not enough for me to paint with black and white.
Inside my head there are shades of red unknown to waking life.
You think you travel far and never see the stars.
Cause the only way is if I say you can follow me that far.

They packed up their families and headed up wind

A poison cloud, a flaming sky
200,000 people and no one died
And all before the pocket dial
Yeah

I keep searchin' and searchin'
I keep searchin' and searchin'

Now I'm stranded, tied on the tracks
There's no hero, there's no villain
There's nobody I can blame, the story's still the same

Concrete, cold brick and sando the place where she prays,
Where she suffers her days.
Sleepless nights with the dirt when the addiction hurts.
Up to that old white oak door church.

And that’s where you find her in that last pew.

You touch her cold hand, your mother is gone.
In front of her God, needle in her arm.
The family plot will be filled.

Out past the quarries and sandpits too.
Swim out among the rocks and cliffs,
Ignorant youth keeps us from death.
Find our way out to the tracks.

Heaven help us if there’s a train,
Dodge it like the beaches of Normandy.

""Ain’t this what, ain’t this what brothers are supposed to do?""

Of picking sides and picking fights between them.

When I wake up in the morning it all feels like a bad dream,
One that follows you and haunts you endlessly.
Yeah haunts me endlessly.

Oh, it feels like days, but it’s been years

Oh, and please don’t call me baby
It’s just too hard to hear
Too hard to hear
Leave you flowers at your headstone
Just sit and talk to you my dear, my dear

728,I Don't Mind,Defeater,"Let’s talk about the old days
Let’s talk about your friends
Let’s talk about the summer
And how you wish it wouldn’t end

Did I forget to tell you
How pretty you looked in that dress?
In the first time that I saw you
You cleaned the mess from my head

And I don’t mind
If we take our time
No, I don’t mind

Lets go walkin’ on the boardwalk
Dip our feet into the sea
Lets find ourselves lost for hours
Until we find ourselves a drink

Lets talk that sun into setting
Just need the sound of your voice
Need that calming and the comfort
Something to drown out the noise

And I don’t mind
If we take our time
’Cause I’m all yours
If you’re all mine

Something I’ve been meanin’ to tell you
About three years and a day
I’d very much like to get married
Maybe have kids and move away

’Cause there ain’t nothing like your smile
Your legs and those eyes
I will beg and steal and borrow
To keep you safe your whole life

And I don’t mind
If we take our time
’Cause I’m all yours
If you’re all mine

729,No Kind Of Home,Defeater,"""Where were you every night that I woke up alone?""
Cold sweat keeps you up.
""This ain’t no kind of home.""

""Come pick me up.""

""Damn those boys at the bar,
Damn the way that you drink.""
Cold sweat, sleepless nights,
When your hands start to shake.
""Damn that pier where you sit,
Damn your vengeance for him
There’s no bringing him back,
Your father is buried and dead.""

But you can’t let go of that hero’s death.
And you’ve been left with,
Left with his debt.

You couldn’t fight for your country
And your mother is an addict.

""How dare you?""
""This ain’t no kind of home.""

""Come pick me up.""

""Damn that man that you humor,
He only wants one thing from you.
Damn those looks that you give him.
Parlor tricks and I’m played for a fool.""

730,Quiet The Longing,Defeater,"You sit, and you stir
You grieve and you grieve
The same chair as your old man
Your mother’s worse than you think
Sunken eyes and a withering frame
The needle quiets the longing
That poison, it fills…; it fills her veins
(One by one, one by one)

So quiet when the pain comes
Your mother’s rosary ain’t bringing father home
Blood rushes with cigarette burns
There ain’t no God coming to save her
So quiet as the clouds roll
Your mother’s rosary wrapped on the bed post
Blood rushes with cigarette burns
On that dock every night until your head hurts

You sit, and you stir
You grieve and you grieve
The longer you sit at the ocean
You lose more time than you think
Your blood runs cold
Wind biting under your coat
Pull it tight to your chest
Your mother is praying for death
Much more than you know

So quiet when the pain comes
Your mother’s rosary ain’t bringing father home
Blood rushes with cigarette burns
There ain’t no God coming to save her
So quiet as the clouds roll
Your mother’s rosary wrapped on the bed post
Blood rushes with cigarette burns
On that dock every night until your head hurts

""You coward (you coward)
This is your fault
Our family
Has lost everything""

Look down at your hands and your lit cigarette
Put it to your lips and breathe it in
Everything starts to fade and your body is numb
And when you wake in the morning you’re in the house all alone

731,Warm Blood Rush,Defeater,"""Dear God, what have you done?""
Those words ring loud in the back of your head.
That bottle lies in a thick, blood red.

""I ain’t no forgiver, forgetter.""
Our mother waits in vain for a God that never loved us.
As much as she prayed, he never showed up.

""Dear God, where have you gone?""
Your brother is gone in the blink of an eye.
That January night, our father lays cold.
""Where are you going to go?
You’re only seventeen years old.""

""I ain’t no forgiver, forgetter.""
Our mother waits in vain for a God that never loved us.
As much as she prayed, he never showed up.

Those cold steel tracks beneath your feet,
Those same rail ties where you dodged those trains.
When we were just two kids, it still feels the same;
That warm blood rush when the train comes.
(When the train comes)

""I ain’t no forgiver, forgetter.""
""I will find you, and put that vice to your head.
Again, and again, and again, and again, and again.""

732,"Waves Crash, Clouds Roll",Defeater,"As the waves crash, the clouds roll.

Sit on the dock waiting for the sun.
Wait for the coward but he never comes.
Pray for revenge on him.
Steam rises as the boats come in,
One by one (one by one).

You know she is gone,
You know there’s no saving her.
You know she is gone, you know.
Her cheating, her weak will, the addiction, that needle.

When you come home to find her lying on the floor,
You’re reminded of those sleepless nights
That will haunt you for the rest of your life.
Blue collar shipyard, any way to keep her alive.
Sun up to sun down,
Blistered hands and a parched mouth.

You know she is gone,
You know there’s no saving her.
You know she is gone, you know.
Her cheating, her weak will, the addiction, that needle.

And it will be the end of your days.
You low-life bookie, you don’t scare me.

I ain’t settling no debt,
I ain’t saving no face.
One more drink then I’m gone
And then I’ll drag you out of this place.""

Put it down for the courage,
Your fists clench with the blood rush.
White knuckles when the hit lands,
Cold concrete and blurred vision.

Stumble home from the bar.
Stuttered steps home to your front door.
On the tip of your tongue, your remorse.
Shamed by the loss and defeat.
Shamed by your let down to her.
The same walk as that first night.
Now alone you know that this ain’t right.
Better days and the promise you made,
Ain’t no man supposed to walk out that way.

Her ring lies in the thick red,
Your tears swell, and the room spins.
""Dear God, what have I done?""

You left her, and he took her, he laid with her.
You bastard’s son.

With the blackout
And the bloodstains,
Your teeth clench,
Then the pain comes.

734,White Oak Doors,Defeater,"Lost in your own head, but then a knock at the door.
Put down that drink, your steps creaking the floor.
Go and get the gun, distract yourself from death.
Back against the door, your hands are starting to sweat.
Slowly cock the gun, slowly move to the side,
Slowly turn the handle, slowly open it wide.
You catch a glimpse of his face. Your heart sinks in your chest;
Your hands start to shake because you know that it’s him.
Just the coward and you standing silent, dead air.
So you pull him inside into your father’s chair.
""Your mother is dead, all thanks to you.
Her addiction got worse after you left you damn fool.
What you did to our father, I promised you’d pay up.
I’m going to take your life, but it don’t feel like enough.""
Cold steel to his head, walk him to his death.

Walk him down past the white oak doors.
Walk him out past the boardwalk and your old shipyard.
Your pistol in his side, make him pay.
On the outskirts of town, pass the old quarry now.
Walk him down to those cold steel tracks.
You stumble drunk with the gun in his back.

""Now get down on your knees on the tracks where you shamed me.
But this time, the dodge ain’t going to end so pretty.
Either a bullet or that train steaming just ahead
Is going to end your days. You coward little kid.""

You sit and you stir, while he waits for his death.
You’ll never forgive him, and you never did forget.
He’ll never see the sun again.
Make him pay off his debt.
Stand on those tracks, cold steel under your feet,
Barrel to his temple. ""Your rotting mother, you will soon re-meet,""
You whisper in his ear, feel his whole body shake.
In an instant he’s got your arm, he’s got your gun, you’re held down by his weight.
You feel the cold steel above and below.
You feel your stomach tie in knots when the train whistle blows.
You feel the warm of the blood where the barrel digs in.
From your cheek to your mouth, you taste the sweat and the tin.
You don’t cry, you don’t beg. You’ve been waiting for this.
For the coward, or for death, just to see your wife again.
That train is so close, so loud and so clear.
Your hands stop shaking and it’s all that you hear.
Just like father. ""You took him.
If this is how it’s going to be
I would rather die at the hands of my own family.""

How to lose everything
How to push you away
How to lie when I say

You begged and you prayed
For your god and his grace

To save you from me

He took my brother to the ocean floor

Bled out and failed him, he never would have done that to me

Means we’re closer to home

Further from what made sense
What we were born to do
What kept the blood in our veins
Keep my veins thin with booze

Kept my hand on my gun
And my gun by my side
Kept the moon in my thoughts
With the sun in my eyes

Kept my head hanging low
Kept my gun by my side
My brother’s name in my head
And the tears from my eyes

Kept the blood in my veins
Kept the blood in my veins
Brother’s name in my head
Kept the blood in my veins

Had me praying for death
For me and my friends
So we would never wake up
To our lovers again

Because every lover had lied
When they said we’d be fine
When they said in good faith
They would sleep alone every night

Hope to come home in one piece
With our boys by our side

Now we’re ragged and the torn
Like the flags that we fly
Like the ones we lay down
On a coffin so clean

See those eyes staring back
The boys we used to be

Kept the blood in my veins
(The waves on the hull, throw your words off the side)
Brother’s name in my head

And the blood in my veins

To pull you out of this hell you’ve been living in
With the needle
And every dying wish I’ve had that you would clean up
Your ups and let downs pulling me underground
With every tired lie you tell just to fill your arm

You thin your veins with the dirt

With the memories and the pain

Still hoping, still waiting
Still breathing by a thread, still holding on

And I lost my faith in your god
In your word
In every promise that you break

Still breathing by a thread, still holding on

To find that back-alley pusher and take his life
And I ain’t ashamed for what I’ve done
I’ll take an eye for an eye until every junkie is blind
The river bed holds the blood and the knife

And I ain’t ashamed for what I’ve done

A mother’s blessing born, a father’s burden worn.
The bright shine of the sunrise along the tile floor to the open door.
With blood on the streets she lay on the mattress.
Staring aimlessly.
Numb, dark and decayed
On the bathroom floor of their rundown apartment.
Scraping fingers on tile just to feel something.
Unwanted by a bastard father.
Unwanted, but through the hazel eyes of his mother.
She’s praying for god to save her.
""Please save me."" but when she needs him most, he doesn’t answer.
Another rosary, another unanswered plea.
""Please take us away, please let us be safe.
Let everyone that sees me forget my face.""
But all she gets is the drunk with his fists and that old devil look in his eye.
Him and Jack, that gambling debt, that old devil look in his eye.
And without warning he raises his hand to her and says,
""Your god can’t hear you, not down here.
No one will save you because no one cares.""
And with her newborn boy, they would cry until the early morning light.
It was the first of many, many sleepless nights.

Heavy hearted hymns heard in slums fade out on those country roads.
Hope burning in his lungs.

Sleeping under sky.
Days pass, weeks pass.
Days turn into nights.
Sleep sound, the sun’s out.
Sleep long, sleep well.
Days pass, weeks pass.
Memories come flooding back,
He prays his mother’s God has saved her soul.
That soap box song still in his head.
Miles lost to heat and rain.
He carries his weight.
That message for the misdirected rings true to this day.
Heavy hearted hymns sung in fields.
He stops along that country road to listen as they sing.
""Swing low, swing low chariot for me. Swing low, swing low. Pray my soul to keep.""
Rest now, the sun’s down. Rest long, rest well.

Thought of those open roads, his mother praying all alone, that vagrant anthem and the field sung hymns, the cowardice forever following him.
""What’s left for me? The world has turned it’s back on me. There’s no place for me.""
A sullen walk to the chapel stairs.
""Regret runs through me.""
A hard pull on that white oak door to face up those fears.
""What brings you here my son?""
""I’ve been a horrible man. I killed my father, I killed my brother, I left my mother in your God’s hands.""
""Clasp your hands and count your sins. Kneel at the pew until the sermon begins. No judgment cast down this day, will set you free. You are forgiven my son, you are blessed and redeemed. You’ve found absolution here son, but only from me.""
""What’s left for me?""
A sullen walk to the steeple top to look over the city.
He carves his name in that old brass bell, so when it rings he can hear it in hell.
One last look to that western sky, one last wish he could have changed his life.
""I ain’t no wicked man.""

""It’s not the same here.""
""Oh, i never thought you would come right to me. I’ve spent years on these docks just waiting after you left, we were left with nothing. Every day what you did ran through me.

""I bet you wish you were dead.""
They walk the rails with a gun to his head.
And so he lay on the ties, just waiting. those racing thoughts through his head came rushing.
He slips out from the weight of the elder.
The younger’s fear once again toppled over.
And now it’s his upper hand, he sees the steam overhead.
This will be the last the elder breathes again.
Roll on through, that train bearing down.
As it ended his days, he somehow knew it would always be this way.
So ends that cold heart’s legacy.

Roll on through to the pits and the rail car yard.

A brother’s dare, that devil’s smirk.
""Oh, this is the way it will always be.""
A kid brother in the shadows of a cold heart’s legacy.
""Oh, this is where we see who runs first. It’s you and me and the train. The steel tracks and the dirt. Oh, you can never live up to me.""
And so he stood trembling, waiting for smoke above the trees.
Roll on through. He could feel it rumbling, he could feel it beneath his feet. Roll on through.
""Closer now, hold your ground. steadfast, ignore the sound.""
Everything went quiet just before the rush took over his head.
The pull and the push of the engine, think back with the coal and the steam.
The racing thoughts, the questions, the adolescent rivalry.
And with a nod from the elder, the younger’s fear topples over.
Over rails and over timber. ""That’s no dodge, you fucking coward.""
And the train rolls on. ""Yellow-belly go home."" and the train rolls on.

750,Forgiver Forgetter,Defeater,"He awoke in a cold sweat to those old sounds of heartbreak.
His brother at his side screaming ""This isn’t your fight.""
But that rush took over his head and he came to his mother’s side.
And he found himself alone with that devil rambling.
""Oh, well the money’s all gone and she can’t pay the rent with that needle in her arm.""
He clenched his fists.
""What did she ever do to you, but raise us by herself when you were too drunk to come through?""
He took a swing.
""That’s some nerve you got kid.""
""Yeah, well they’ll put that on your tombstone as the last thing that you said. I never wanted to kill a man, like i want to kill you, man.""
The years of pain boiled over, trading blows across the counter.
And when that devil was down he grabbed for his empty old friend Jack.
He caught his eye as he took his last breath and that vice went to his head again and again.
""Dear God, what have you done?"" cried out his mother.
""That devil drunk was no father. Another name on a list for unpaid bookies and gambling debts.""
That spiteful stare of his brother.
""I ain’t no forgiver or forgetter. I’ll make you pay for this when you least expect it.""

Out there on rolling hills, he thought of days back home. all the pain and hurt, his mother praying alone. sleep never came for him, no rest for wicked men. in those starless skies, the moon shined shame on him. he found redemption in pale saints that took him in. his grey eyes, hopefulness, that only youth can feel before life sours them.

""Where you from, where you been?"" the boy would ask. he could never answer, it was the truth he lacked. ""i’m from nowhere kid, i’ve been to hell and back. i’m a loner kid, i got no grace and no tact."" he had nothing more than those simple words. he was a runner and a coward always losing his way. still no sleep for him.

""I ain’t no wicked man."" there would be no night like this for him ever again. he would change his fate, he would mend the breaks. he left that night with parting words to lead his way.
""Don’t you be like me.""

And so that moonlit sky shined praise down on him.

752,Nameless Streets,Defeater,"As a kid the summers seemed so long.
The dusk; a never ending song.
Too much, too young.
He’d never hear it again.
A walk through the dismal streets, the alleys where the junkies sleep.
Too much, too young.
""That will never be me.""
Slow, hand in hand to the boardwalk’s end.
His mother’s words like the biting wind.
""Please don’t leave me.""
He’ll never hear them again.
""Keep quiet, stay out of sight.""
Her sunken eyes that used to burn so bright.
""Please don’t leave me.""
So he hid pressed against the wall, under stairs in the darkened hall.
The sound of heartbreak reminded him of home.
Shadows move slow across the floor, a minute seemed like a day or more.
The end of heartache when she opened the door.
The sights, sounds, smell of burnt out shame, pride, spite and love.
They all come here to die.
He sobs, ""Please take me a away. Please mother bring us home safe on nameless streets the way we came.""
Suddenly, she prayed for better days and for redemption.
Sullenly she prayed to keep from harm’s way and for conviction.
But there’s no forgiveness here.
No hope beyond that pier.
No way to get out now, not for her in this dead end town.
And that drunk is waiting up, him and jack and the empty cup.
""Where you been? What you on? Who’d you fuck?""
One more drink to toast good luck.
She gets a stiff hand from the old like the bourbon he’s been drinking.
Black out.

753,Prophet In Plain Clothes,Defeater,"He walks the streets collar up to the snowfall.
Holes in pockets and knees.
Sleeps in bar rooms and horse stalls.
But you can’t stay too long in one place.
""Move along kid, we don’t like your face.""
Mother’s hold children close out of fear.
Father’s curse under breath as they sneer.
He walks the streets, years pass by with the snowfall.
Time is wasted in drink, days begging and lost souls.
Holds no merit in vagrants in boxcars.
Down in hell you best know who your friends are.
""Not so proud scrounging for your next meal. No alibis sold when with devils you deal. How does it feel to be all alone with no direction? Home is never home, it’s just the place where you came from.""
""Home is never home,"" writ on walls of the church and the hostels.
""Home is never home,"" said by martyrs and lost souls.
""Home is never home,"" said the prophet in plain clothes as he strummed his guitar.
And he screamed, and he sang:
""Well I’ve been tired because I don’t sleep that well on trains.
Well i got ups and downs but days are all the same.
I’ve been low but it never gets me down.
Well I’ve been thrown out, I’ve been let down, I’ve been shamed.
Well I’ve had hardships, I’ve been stripped of pride and name.
I’ve been low but it never gets me down
And i spent drinkin’ all the worry from my head
In days spent wonderin’, wishin’ I was dead.
If only i could muster the words out from my mouth.
I would sing.
Oh i would sing.
I’d take the next train out.
Cause I’ve been hopin’ I’ve been prayin’ there’s some God.
So when i die I’m saved and found and I’m not lost.
Cause all he’s done, all for me is take away the ones I love.
And i spent drinkin’ all the worry from my head.
In days spent wonderin’, wishin’ Q was dead…
If only I could muster the words out from my mouth.
I would sing.
Oh, i would sing.
I’d take the next train out.
I’m gonna take it…""

754,The Blues,Defeater,"He found himself waiting again.
Out at the crossroads, out on the lam.
This time not running, this time by right.
A road-side hitcher waits for headlights.
""The blues won’t bring me down.""
That pick-up truck stopped. ""Where you headed, kid?""
""Back to the boardwalk coast to fix the wrong I did.""
That old man would bring him just as far as he could.
His hellhound sniffing out for a trace of any good.
The hope he’s chasing.
The blues he carried are dead and buried.

755,The City By Dawn,Defeater,"Hard rain fell. Chalk it up to a failure.
Push through the cold weather.
Racing heart, slow the beat, push through the defeat.
No one knows, just push through the deadbeats, junkies, liars and cutthroats.
The same walk, the same pier.
No one’s going to remember him here.
""Just walk until you reach those long steel tracks.""
That old familiar sting, the memories of rivalry.
Years passed and it’s still here.
The same dirt, the same rails, the same fear.
And all the years of giving in rushed through his head again.
With no loss to match his gain, he rolled on to hop that train.
That rain fell hard.
Chalk the miles from his failure.
Trees sway with the weather.
Racing heart, slow the beat.
Every crossed town line is relief.
With no money and no name, state lines, borders rivers are all the same.
The city by dawn, a stranger with no history comes.
""Just rest your head where the sun sets. Fade out at sun down.""

Where holiness is never found

Scattered without a trace
And all you can think about is me

I’ll wait for you
(I’ll wait, I’ll wait for you)
Buildings come crashing down
Fire is all around
I’ll wait, I’ll wait for you

Keep your head held up high
I’ll be somewhere in the shapes that twist the sky
I know soon we will reunite
Your embrace will surely keep us alive

Fire is all around
I’ll wait, I’ll wait for you
Strolls on blackened ground
What’s lost, will never be found
I’ll wait, I’ll wait

776,Sultans of Swing,Dire Straits,"You get a shiver in the dark
It’s raining in the park but meantime
South of the river you stop and you hold everything
A band is blowing Dixie double four time
You feel alright when you hear that music ring

Well now you step inside but you don’t see too many faces
Coming in out of the rain to hear the jazz go down
Competition in other places
Ah but the horns, they blowing that sound
Way on down south, way on down south, London town

You check out Guitar George, he knows all the chords
Mind, he’s strictly rhythm, he doesn’t want to make it cry or sing
Yes, and an old guitar is all he can afford
When he gets up under the lights to play his thing

And Harry doesn’t mind if he doesn’t make the scene
He’s got a daytime job, he’s doing alright
He can play the honky tonk like anything
Saving it up for Friday night
With the Sultans, with the Sultans of Swing

And a crowd of young boys, they’re fooling around in the corner
Drunk and dressed in their best brown baggies and their platform soles
They don’t give a damn about any trumpet playing band
It ain’t what they call rock and roll
Then the Sultans, yeah, the Sultans they play Creole
Creole

And then the man, he steps right up to the microphone
And says at last, just as the time bell rings
""Goodnight, now it’s time to go home""
Then he makes it fast with one more thing
""We are the Sultans, we are the Sultans of Swing""

Are a home now for me
But my home is the lowlands
And always will be
Some day you’ll return to
Your valleys and your farms
And you’ll no longer burn
To be brothers in arms

Through these fields of destruction
Baptisms of fire
I’ve witnessed your suffering
As the battle raged higher
And though they did hurt me so bad
In the fear and alarm
You did not desert me
My brothers in arms

There’s so many different worlds
So many different suns
And we have just one world
But we live in different ones

Now the sun’s gone to hell
And the moon’s riding high
Let me bid you farewell
Every man has to die
But it’s written in the starlight
And every line in your palm
We’re fools to make war
On our brothers in arms

783,The Sound Of Silence,Disturbed,"Hello darkness, my old friend
I’ve come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
’Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dared
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools,"" said I, ""You do not know.
Silence, like a cancer, grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you.
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words, like silent raindrops fell
And echoed in the wells, of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds of silence

Leave me alone, let me be this time
You carry on like a holy man pushing redemption
I don’t want to mention, the reason I know

That I am stricken and can’t let you go
When the heart is cold, there’s no hope, and we know
That I am crippled by all that you’ve done
Into the abyss will I run

You don’t know what your power has done to me
I want to know if I’ll heal inside
I can’t go on with a holocaust about to happen
Seeing you laughing another time
You’ll never know why your face has haunted me
My very soul has to bleed this time
Another hole in the wall of my inner defenses
Leaving me breathless, the reason I know

That I am stricken and can’t let you go
When the heart is cold, there’s no hope, and we know
That I am crippled by all that you’ve done

787,A Change of Seasons,Dream Theater,"I remember a time
My frail, virgin mind
Watched the crimson sunrise
Imagined what it might find
Life was filled with wonder
I felt the warm wind blow
I must explore the boundaries
Transcend the depth of winter's snow

Innocence caressing me
I never felt so young before
There was so much life in me
Still I longed to search for more

But those days are gone now
Changed like a leaf on a tree
Blown away forever
Into the cool autumn breeze
The snow has now fallen
And my sun's not so bright
I struggle to hold on
With the last of my might

In my den of inequity
Viciousness and subtlety
Struggle to ease the pain
Struggle to find the same

Ignorance surrounding me
I've never been so filled with fear
All my life's been drained from me
The end is drawing near...

""Carpe diem
Seize the day""

I'll always remember
The chill of November
The news of the fall
The sounds in the hall
The clock on the wall
Ticking away
""Seize the Day""
I heard him say
Life will not always be this way
Look around
Hear the sounds
Cherish your life
While you're still around

(""Gather ye rosebuds while ye may)
(Old Time is still a-flying;)
(And this same flower that smiles today)
(Tomorrow will be dying"")

We can learn
From the past
But those days
Are gone
We can hope
For the future
But there might not be one

The words stuck in my mind
Alive from what I've learned
I have to seize the day
To home I returned

Preparing for her flight
I held with all my might
Fearing my deepest fright
She walked into the night
She turned for one last look
She looked me in the eye
I said, ""I Love You...
Good-bye""

(""It's the most awful thing you'll ever hear"")
(""If you're lying to me..."")
(""Oh, you dearly love her"")
(""...just have to leave...)
(All our lives"")
(""Seize the day!"")
(""Something happened"")
(""Gather ye rosebuds while ye may"")
(""She was killed"")

So far or so it seems
All is lost
With nothing fulfilled
Off the pages and the
T.V. screen
Another world
Where nothing's true

Tripping through
The life fantastic
Lose a step
And never get up
Left alone
With a cold blank stare
I feel like giving up

I was blinded by a paradise
Utopia high in the sky
A dream that only drowned me
Deep in sorrow, wondering why

Oh come let us adore him
Abuse and then ignore him
No matter what
Don't let him be
Let's feed upon his misery
Then string him up for all the world to see

I'm sick of all
Your hypocrites
Holding me at bay
And I don't need
Your sympathy
To get me through the day

Seasons change and so can I
Hold on Boy
No time to cry
Untie these strings
I'm climbing down
I won't let them push me away

Oh come let us adore him
Abuse and then ignore him
No matter what
Don't let him be
Let's feed upon
His misery
Now it's time for them
To deal with me

I'm much wiser now
A lifetime of memories
Run through my head
They taught me how
For better or worse
Alive or dead
I realize
There's no turning back
Life goes on
The offbeaten track

I sit down with my son
Set to see the Crimson Sunset
(Gather ye rosebuds while ye may)
Many years have come and gone
I've lived my life, but now must move on
(Gather ye rosebuds while ye may)
He's my only one
Now that my time has come
Now that my life is done
We look into the sun
""Seize the day
And don't you cry
Now it's time
To say good-bye
Even though
I'll be gone
I will live on
Live on""

but it's too late for me now

Melody walks through the door
and memory flies out the window
and nobody knows what they want
'til they finally let it all go

The pain inside
coming outside

So many ways to drown a man
So many ways to drag him down
Some are fast and some take years and years
Can't hear what he's saying when he's talking in his sleep
He finally found the sound but he's in too deep

I could never get over
Is it too late for me now?
Feel like blowing my cover

Melody walks through the door
and memory flies out the window
and nobody knows what they want
'til they finally let it all go

No energy for anger

With confidence and self-
control

I look at the world and see no

I'm waiting to find some sense
of strength
I'm begging you from the
bottom of my heart to show
me understanding

I need to live life
Like some people never will
So find me kindness
Find me beauty
Find me truth
When temptation brings me to
my knees
And I lay here drained of
strength
Show me kindness
Show me beauty
Show me truth

The way your heart sounds
makes all the difference
It's what decides if you'll endure
the pain that we all feel
The way your heart beats
makes all the difference
In learning to live
Here before me is my soul
I'm learning to live
I won't give up
Till I've no more to give

Listening to the city
Whispering its violence
I set out watching from above
The 90s bring new questions
New solutions to be found
I fell in love to be let down

Once again we dance in the
crowd
At times a step away
From a common fear that's all
spread out
It won't listen to what you say
Once you're touched you stand
alone
To face the bitter fight
Once I reached for love
And now I reach for life

Another chance to lift my life
Free the sensation in my heart
To ride the wings of dreams
into changing horizons
It brings inner peace within my
mind,
As I'm lifted from where I've
spilt my life
I hear an innocent voice
I hear kindness, beauty and
truth

The way your heart sounds
makes all the difference
It's what decides if you'll endure
the pain that we all feel
The way your heart beats
makes all the difference
In learning to live
Spread before you is your soul
So forever hold the dreams
within our hearts
Through nature's inflexible
grace

Arrived early May
She carried a gift from her home
The night shed a tear
To tell her of fear
And of sorrow and pain
She'll never outgrow

Death is the first dance, eternal

There's no more freedom
The both of you will be confined to this mind

I was told there's a miracle for each day that I try
I was told there's a new love that's born for each one that has died
I was told there'd be no one to call on when I feel alone and afraid
I was told if you dream of the next world
You'll find yourself swimming in a lake of fire

As a child, I thought I could live without pain, without sorrow
As a man I've found it's all caught up with me
I'm asleep yet I'm so afraid

Somewhere like a scene from a memory
There's a picture worth a thousand words
Eleuding stares from faces before me
It hides away and will never be heard of again

Deceit is the second without end

The city's cold blood teaches us to survive
Just keep my heart in your eyes and we'll stay alive

The third arrives

Before the leaves have fallen
Before we lock the doors
There must be the third and last dance
This one will last forever
Metropolis watches and thoughtfully smiles
She's taken you to your home

It can only take place
When the struggle between our children has ended
Now the Miracle and the Sleeper know that the third is love

Love is the Dance of Eternity

793,Pull me under,Dream Theater,"Lost in the sky
Clouds roll by
And I roll with them
Arrows fly
Seas increase
And then fall again

This world is spinning around me
This world is spinning without me
Every day sends future to past
Every breath leaves me one less
To my last

Watch the sparrow falling
Gives new meaning to it all
If not today nor yet tomorrow
Then some other day

I'll take seven lives for one
And then my only father's son
As sure as I did ever love him
I am not afraid

This world is spinning around me
The whole world keeps
Spinning around me
All life is future to past
Every breath leaves me one less
To my last

Pull me under
Pull me under
Pull me under I'm not afraid
All that I feel is honor and spite
All I can do is set it right

Dust fills my eyes
Clouds roll by
And I roll with them
Centuries cry
Orders fly
And I fall again

This world is spinning inside me
The whole world is
Spinning inside of me
Every day sends future to past
Every step brings me closer
To my last

Pull me under
Pull me under
Pull me under I'm not afraid
Living my life too much in
The sun
Only until your will is done

794,Surrounded,Dream Theater,"Morning comes too early
and nighttime falls too late
And sometimes all I want to do
is wait
The shadow I've been hiding in
has fled from me today

I know it's easier to walk away
than look it in the eye
But I will raise a shelter to the sky
and here beneath this
star tonight I'll lie
She will slowly yield the light
As I awaken from the longest
night

Dreams are shaking
Set sirens waking up tired eyes
With the light the memories
all rush into his head

By a candle stands a mirror
Of his heart and soul she
dances
She was dancing thru the night
above his bed

And walking to the window
he throws the shutters out
against the wall
And from an ivory tower hears
her call
""Let light surround you""

It's been a long, long time
He's had a while to think it over
In the end he only sees the
change
Light to dark
Dark to light
Light to dark
Dark to light

Heaven must be more than this
When angels waken with a kiss
Sacred hearts won't take the
pain
But mine will never be the same

He stands before the window
His shadow slowly fading from
the wall
And from an ivory tower hears
her call
""Let the light surround you""

Once lost but I was found
When I heard the stained glass
shatter all around me
I sent the spirits tumbling
down the hill
But I will hold this one on high
above me still
She whispers words to clear my mind
I once could see but now at last
I'm blind

I know it's easier to walk away
than look it in the eye
But I had given all that
I could take
And now I've only habits left
to break
Tonight I'll still be lying here
Surrounded in all the light

795,Take the time,Dream Theater,"Just let me catch my breath...
I've heard the promises
I've seen the mistakes
I've had my fair share of tough
breaks
I need a new voice, a new law,
a new way
Take the time, reevaluate
It's time to pick up the pieces,
Go back to square one
I think it's time for a change

There is something that I feel
To be something that is real
I feel the heat within my mind
And craft new changes with
my eyes
Giving freely wandering
promises
A place with decisions I'll
fashion
I won't waste another breath

You can feel the waves coming on
(It's time to take the time)
Let them destroy you or carry
you on
(It's time to take the time)
You're fighting the weight of
the world
But no one can save you this
time
Close your eyes
You can find all you need in
your mind

The unbroken spirit
Obscured and disquiet
Finds clearness this trial
demands
And at the end of this day sighs
an anxious relief
For the fortune lies still in his
hands

If there's pensive fear, a
wasted year
A man must learn to cope
If his obsession's real,
Suppression that he feels must
turn to hope

Life is no more assuring than
love
(It's time to take the time)
There are no answers from
voices above
(It's time to take the time)
You're fighting the weight of
the world
And no one can save you this
time
Close your eyes
You can find all you need in
your mind

I close my eyes
And feel the water rise around
me
Drown the bead of time
Let my senses fall away
I can see much clearer now,
I'm blind

Find all you need in your mind
If you take the time

796,Under a glass moon,Dream Theater,"Tell me
Remind me
Chase the water racing from
the sky
Always beside me
Taste the memories running
from my eyes
Nervous flashlights scan my
dreams
Liquid shadows silence their
screams
I smile at the moon
Chasing water from the sky
I argue with the clouds
Stealing beauty from my eyes

Outside the soundness of your
mind
Bathing your soul in silver tears
Beneath a blackened summer sky
Praying for time to disappear

Beneath a summer sky
Under glass moonlight
Night awaits the lamb's arrival
Liquid shadows crawl
Silver teardrops fall
The bride subsides to her
survival

By your hand
I've awakened
Bear this honor in my nam

797,Wait for sleep,Dream Theater,"Standing by the window
Eyes upon the moon
Hoping that the memory
will leave his spirit soon

She shuts the doors and lights
And lays her body on the bed
Where images and words are
running deep
She has too much pride to pull
the sheets above her head
So quietly she lays and waits
for sleep

She stares at the ceiling
And tries not to think
And pictures the chains
She's been trying to link again
But the feeling is gone

And water can't cover her
memory
And ashes can't answer her
pain
God give me the power to take
breath from a breeze
And call life from a cold metal
frame

In with the ashes
Or up with the smoke from the
fire
With wings up in heaven
Or here, lying in bed
Palm of her hand to my head
Now and forever curled in my
heart
And the heart of the world

798,Octavarium,Dream Theater,"I. Someone Like Him
I never wanted to become someone like him so secure
Content to live each day just like the last
I was sure I knew that
This was not for me
And I wanted so much more
Far beyond what I could see
So I swore that I’d
Never be someone like him

So many years have passed
Since I proclaimed
My independence
My mission
My aim
And my vision
So secure
Content to live each day like it’s my last
It’s wonderful to know
That I could be
Something more than what I dreamed
Far beyond what I could see
Still I swear that I’m
Missing out this time

As far as I could tell
There’s nothing more I need
But still I ask myself
Could this be everything
Then all I swore
That I would never be was now
So suddenly
The only thing
I wanted
To become
To be someone just like him

II. Medicate (Awakening)

A Doctor sitting next to me
He asks me how I feel
Not sure I understand his questioning
He says I’ve been away a while
But thinks he has cured me
From a state of catatonic sleep

For 30 years
Where have I been
Eyes open
But not getting through to me

Medicate me
Infiltrate me
Side effects appear
As my conscience slips away

Medicate me
Science failing
Conscience fading fast
Can’t you stop what’s happening

A higher dosage she prescribes
But there’s no guarantee
I feel it starting to take over me
I tell him not to be ashamed
There’s no one who’s to blame
A second shot
A brief awakening

I feel the relapse
Can’t break free
Eyes open
But not getting through to me

Medicate me
Infiltrate me
Side effects appear
As my conscience slips away

Medicate me
Science failing
Conscience fading fast
Can’t you stop what’s happening

Sailing on the seven seize the day tripper diem’s ready
Jack the Ripper Owens Wilson Phillips and my supper’s ready
Lucy in the sky with Diamond Dave’s not here I come to save the
Day for Nightmare Cinema show me the way to get back home again

(Running forward, falling back)
Spinning round and round
(Looking outward, reaching in)
Scream without a sound
(Leaning over, crawling up)
Stumbling all around
(Losing my place, only to)
Find I’ve come full circle

Flying off the handle with careful with
That axe Eugene Gene the dance machine
Messiah light my fire gabba gabba
Hey hey my my generation’s home again

Spinning round and round
(Looking outward, reaching in)
Scream without a sound

Stumbling all around
(Losing my place, only to)
Find I’ve come full circle

IV. Intervals

Our deadly sins feel his mortal wrath
Remove all obstacles from our path

Asking questions
Search for clues
The answer’s been right in front of you

Try to break through
Long to connect
Fall on deaf ears and failed muted breath

Loyalty, trust, faith and desire
Carries love through each darkest fire

Tortured insanity
A smothering hell
Try to escape but to no avail

The calls of admirers
Who claim they adore
Drain all your lifeblood while begging for more

Innocent victims of merciless crimes
Fall prey to some madman’s impulsive designs

Step after step
We try controlling our fate
When we finally start living it has become too late

Trapped inside this Octavarium
Trapped inside this Octavarium
Trapped inside this Octavarium
Trapped inside this Octavarium

V. Razor’s Edge

We move in circles
Balanced all the while
On a gleaming razor’s edge

A perfect sphere
Colliding with our fate
This story ends where it began

803,Don't,Ed Sheeran,"I met this girl late last year
She said ""Don’t you worry if I disappear""
I told her ""I’m not really looking for another mistake""
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away four months until our paths crossed again
She told me ""I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around ten
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We’ll be in between the sheets till the late AM""
Baby, if you wanted me then should have just said, she’s singing

Don’t fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don’t wanna know that, babe
Don’t fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don’t wanna know that, babe

For a couple weeks I only wanna see her
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
Before a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she’s staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha, all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don’t want to either
But me and her, we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes, the same day
And those shows have never been what it’s about
But maybe we’ll go together and just figure it out
I’d rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
But we should get on a plane or we’ll be missing it now
Wish I’d have written it down, the way that things played out
But she was kissing him, how? I was confused about
She should figure it out, while I’m sat here singing

Don’t fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don’t wanna know that, babe
Don’t fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don’t wanna know that, babe

*Knock knock knock* on my hotel door
I don’t even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder, but I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next
But you didn’t need to take him to bed, that’s all
And I never saw him as a threat
Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
It’s not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor
And I wasn’t looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun, and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realized what you wanted
It’s a bit too much, too late if I’m honest
All this time, God knows I’m singing

Don’t fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don’t wanna know that, babe
Don’t fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don’t wanna know that, babe

Don’t fuck with my love

804,I See Fire,Ed Sheeran,"Oh misty eye of the mountain below
Keep careful watch of my brothers’ souls
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke
Keep watching over Durin’s sons

If this is to end in fire then we shall all burn together
Watch the flames climb high into the night
Calling out father oh, stand by and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountainside

And if we should die tonight, we should all die together
Raise a glass of wine for the last time
Calling out father oh, prepare as we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountainside
Desolation comes upon the sky

Now I see fire
Inside the mountain, I see fire
Burning the trees
And I see fire
Hollowing soul
I see fire
Blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me

Oh should my people fall then surely I’ll do the same
Confined in mountain halls, we got too close to the flame
Calling out father oh, hold fast and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountainside
Desolation comes upon the sky

Now I see fire
Inside the mountain
I see fire
Burning the trees
And I see fire
Hollowing soul
I see fire
Blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me

And if the night is burning I will cover my eyes
For if the dark returns then my brothers will die
And as this sky is falling down, it crashed into this lonely town
And with that shadow upon the ground I hear my people screaming out

And I see fire
Inside the mountains
I see fire
Burning the trees
I see fire
Hollowing souls
I see fire
Blood in the breeze

And all my hope
All my words are all over written on the signs

See the flames inside my eyes
It burns so bright I wanna feel your love
Easy baby maybe I’m a light
Before tonight I wanna fall in love
And put your faith in my stomach

A mess of this time
Late last night
Drinking to suppress devotion
With fingers intertwined
I can’t shake this feeling now
We’re going through the motions
Hoping it stops
And though I’ve only caused you pain
You know with all of my words
With all this beloved
Although all the lies spoke
When you’re my road walking me home
Home, home, home

See the flames inside my eyes
It burns so bright I wanna feel your love
Easy baby maybe I’m a light
Before tonight I wanna fall in love

Just promise me, you’ll always be a friend
’Cause you are the only one

But it’s the only thing that I know
When it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes

We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Our hearts are never broken
And time’s forever frozen still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
You won’t ever be alone, wait for me to come home

Loving can heal, loving can mend your soul
And it’s the only thing that I know
I swear it will get easier, remember that with every piece of you,
And it’s the only thing we take with us when we die

We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Our hearts were never broken
And time’s forever frozen still

So you can keep me

Next to your heartbeat where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul
And if you hurt me
That’s okay baby, only words bleed

Under the lamppost back on Sixth Street
Hearing you whisper through the phone

To hold your body close
Take another step into the no man’s land

This love is ablaze
I saw flames from the side of the stage
And the fire brigade comes in a couple of days
Until then we got nothing to say and nothing to know
But something to drink and maybe something to smoke
Let it go until our roads are changed
Singing ""We Found Love"" in a local rave, no
I don’t really know what I’m supposed to say
But I can just figure it out and hope and pray
I told her my name and said ""it’s nice to meet ya""
Then she handed me of a bottle of water filled with tequila
I already know if she’s a keeper
Just from this one small act of kindness
I’m in deep if anybody finds out
I’m meant to drive home but I drunk all of it down
Not sober enough we just sit on the couch
One thing led to another now she’s kissing my mouth

Before the beats kicks in again
Can you feel it?

As if no one knows anything but us

Your silhouette over me
The way it brings out the blue in your eyes
Is the Tenerife Sea

And all of the voices surrounding us here
They just fade out when you take a breath
Just say the word and I will disappear
Into the wilderness

And should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know it’s enough for me
Cause all that you are is all that I’ll ever need

I’m so in love, so in love
So in love, so in love

Cause all that you are is all that I’ll ever need

I’m so in love, so in love
So in love, love, love, love,
So in love

You looked so wonderful in your dress
I loved your hair like that
And in the moment I knew you back

810,Thinking Out Loud,Ed Sheeran,"When your legs don’t work like they used to before
And I can’t sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks

And darling I will be loving you till we’re seventy
And baby my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three
And I’m thinking ’bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Oh me I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am

So honey now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I’m thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are

When my hair’s all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don’t remember my name
When my hands don’t play the strings the same way
I know you will still love me the same

’Cause honey your soul can never grow old
It’s evergreen
And baby your smile’s forever in my mind and memory
And I’m thinking ’bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe it’s all part of a plan
I’ll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you’ll understand

But baby now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I’m thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are

So baby now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Oh darling, place your head on my beating heart
I’m thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are
Oh maybe we found love right where we are
And we found love right where we are

812,Escape From Ohio,Electric Six,"There were 20, maybe 25 of us
Driving out to California in a bus
We were looking for a good time
And a radio station we could trust

Suddenly we heard an angry thud
And our mighty chariot turned into a dud
We were stopped there in our tracks, man
Adjacent to some cows chewing their cud

Lord, please send some mercy down to me
(50 miles south of Bowling Green)
This will clearly never be my scene
(Why does every city start with ""C""?)

There’s only one sure thing that I know:
I’ve gotta get out of Ohio
’til then I’ll never feel love

They say that what you give’s what you’re gonna get
It’s no wonder everything’s gone to shit
’Cause they’ve given us John Boehner
And you better believe they’ve given us Jean Schmidt

Now the floodgates of hell have opened wide
That’s a bad idea, all politics aside
They’re gonna roll out Joe the Plumber
Just to make sure our minds get properly fried

Lord, be merciful and let me die
(50 miles south of Lodi)
Round on both ends and the middle’s high
(What’s so great about a buckeye?)

Whose might is riptide and undertow
There’s no escaping from Ohio!
I’ll never get to feel love

(Hey!)

The walls, they’re closing in
But I’m just inside of Michigan
The only way that I’ll attain ’ya
Is if I get over to Pennsylvania

Except for GBV and Devo
Nothing seems to redeem Ohio
It is the state that killed my love

(Hey!)

Don’t you want to come with me

(Hey!)

And make a break for Kentucky?

(Hey!)

I still got something to put in ’ya

(Hey!)

But we’ll have to go to West Virginia

And I’ve heard great things about Indiana, too

813,White Eyes,Electric Six,"Living in the basement and losing my mind
Smoking mother nature until I go blind
And if you live long enough you’re bound to see it all
For example, take the girlie apparition in my hall

Shaking her finger and looking at me,
But there’s something not right about the way she sees
She got white eyes
She say, “everybody here gonna have white eyes”
(She got white eyes)
Unless
Under three pairs of glasses there’s some glass, some glass, some glass

Now a week in the country is just what I need
It gets so quiet I can hear myself bleed
And there’s a moon on the mountain
A wind through the trees
And I still couldn’t tell you how that ghost girl sees
She seems to be committing an optical crime
She is a spectral spectacle looking at me all the time
With white eyes
She say, “everybody here gonna have white eyes”
(She got white eyes)
When they die
And if you’ve got those baby blues, baby, get ready to kiss ’em goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

Things are no longer what they might seem
When her freight train picks up its head of steam
There’s no clear line between death and dream and the ferocious haze of love

Now the gates are swinging open
And I’m coming through
And I can hear the choir start singing their tune
As I take my last steps toward that guiding light
I can hear that ghost laughing as my eyeballs turn white

(I got white eyes)
I say, “everybody here gonna have white eyes”
(I got white eyes)
Like me
It ain’t until you lose your sight that you know just what it means to see

“Valentine, what’s your recipe for love?”
My answer’s always the same:
“Cook the hell out of it and slice it”

If music be the food of love, play on
But I’m really too hungry for just one song
And so I pose a final plea to you
I’d really like another slice of you
That’s so nice of you (slices of you)
I’d really like another slice of you

No matter what day, I’m coming right back to you

Who can tell the gauge of its veil?
Who can manifest the size of its maw?
And infer the value of its stones?

Yet the glowing wick will not be quenched
The sown fire will never die

What is
What ever was
What ever is to come
What would
What ever should
It will remain as it never was

Eternity’s past was repeated in time
The eternal knot will be unbroken
Whence comes the motion in this picture?
Where does the moment go when it steals away?
Who will pen the pages of time?
Who will be the audience when the curtain rises?

Where do we go. Question mark.

Whither went what was. Question mark.

So take the fucking plunge

United we’ll stand

This is V for vengeance
This is V for vehemence
This is V for victory

Impetuous furor
The bite of our blades
Let them see our freedom’s ensign
Let us raise our clenched fists in pride

What benefit will it be
To save your crowns but forfeit your freedom at last?
We are one folk and we can make a stand
So lay down your crowns now
Rise and unite

As one, we’ll prevail

This is V for valour
This is V for venture

818,Lugdunon,Eluveitie,"We set forth, a retinue with steed and cart
So we roved the land stealthily
We sallied out to find new shores
As the passage led

Set sail, ye hearts into the sea of hope
The druid blessed this mount foreseen
We grudged no pains, we faced distress
Yet a glowing wick kindles fire…

Alike, a liminal place, a dormant beacon we faced
The haven foretold a fortress of ages to come
At the rise of a new dawn, woke the daughter of the sun
Wafted on black wings, vastly soaring boding skies

We followed the rites of old
As we took out the ordained new land
We held our breath as the skies got black
And a storm arose, a swarm of crows

Lo and behold! The black birds branched out
A circle wide in the riven skies
They lined the nemeton of the fulgent hill
And again, and again, and again the presage witnessed

Adiantunne ni exverti
Adiantunne ni nappisetu

Clear the ring for oppression and greed

Of blight and havoc
Once known as my home

Deleting fulfilled
Erasing procedure done
Cleansing complete
It’s done, my friend
It’s over and done

There was nothing left
But the smell of salassian blood
Nil and nothing left
But the braying void in our homes

I never forgot the eyes of the kids
Wrested from their moms
To be sold into slavery
I still can hear
The cries of the raped
And the bellow of the flames
The hymn of absurd death

Heed the chronicles
Of lucrative genocide
The annals of effaced tribes
Pages written in blood

Ave Caesar Augustus

It’s over and done

History is written in blood,
Yet are battles really lost
On the battlefields?
Canst thou tell me whence thou comest
And where thou goest
And what is, or what was, or what is to come?
For everything remains as it never was.

I haunt your fears
Though you don’t know of my duty
To lead your path
Because I’ll take you home to rest
In my black wings, enfolding you

I am the icon sublime
The guide of the voyage clandestine
I sing the verses bewailed
I, torch of the radiant way

Once you step out
Hearken the strokes of my wings
Once you will leave your cocoon
I will be there

I haunt your fears
Though you don’t know of my duty
To lead your path
Because I’ll take you home to rest
In my black wings, enfolding you

And death will smile his barefaced smile
Initiating your final anguish
It is not before my arrival
That you will be led to feel
The natural serenity of leaving this world…
Hear my wings caressing the wind!
Hear my cry…

The fire’s arcane consuming flames
Sparks to imbue our very souls

Flickering from the depths of eternity

Never asleep, never extinct
Not ever ceasing to gleam
Never sear the sempiternal embers
Never profaned, never fail
Not ever ceasing to refine
Never forfeit, never faint
The sempiternal embers

The essence of being, the form of existance
Forever inflamed with passion, heart of hearts
Burning so bright, yet clandestine

Gleaming in the lair of the powers to be
The four mighty ones the high kings concealed

Giving birth to the glimmer within
Incessantly fostering the flames…

Glowing and blazing in the wind of times

Sparks to imbue our very souls

That a plain, poor man got sick of his yoke of condemned soil
And a foreign empire’s hungry purse
Time to replace pitchfork with sword
And sound the anthem of sheer rebellion

Enough
Once too often
Enough is enough

We strive not for war
We just crave to have our home
We just seek to have our rights
That our fathers used to have

But we tasted the grime and blood
We tasted the essence of ashes

A glowing spark
Rising up from blazing flames
To lead the forlorn and wroth
The epitome of hope and freedom
A daring venture
A frenetic attempt
When Amandus was slain
The Bagaudae still sang

A frothy poor excuse for your foray
To disengage from the deeps

Whilst the crucial weapon’s not the pillum

Sanctimoniously thanking you for the hospitality
Her treacherous intentions as cold as the occasional gusts of wind kissing your back
You mistake the twinkle in her eyes for pure warm-heartedness, and have no premonition of their effect on you.
A bleak smile flickering on her lips, she beholds you with algid satisfaction, as in her sinister mind, you become her prey, her treasure, a sacrifice on the altar of her own lust.
Cursed and sacred, this arcane exercise, disembodied fiend waving through her gaze. Being a virtuoso of deceit and facetiousness, she leaves you with no chance of escape
From what is happening in your mind.
She hasn’t come to crush your bones, nor tear your flesh.
She has come to steal your sanity with just one glance.

While we perish
While I lay down a crimson rose
While holding hands
Are forced apart
While hopes bog like condemned men

Were you there?

The sky is falling on me
As your hand’s turning old and weak
I’m giving myself up to thee
A futile sacrifice gone sere

In your nemeton
These grey stone walls
Are cold and silent
As the fallen
Mother gone deaf
Mistress of shattered hopes
And forever broken dreams

Were you there?

As your hand’s turning old and weak
I’m giving myself up to thee
A futile sacrifice gone sere

Epo, epo why hast thou forsaken me?
Together we go unsung
Into thy hand I commend my spirit
Together we go down with our people

As the children’s cries trailed off

And as they too will die one day,
Our songs will live on
And will be sung by our children

The raveners insatiate

My motionless stance - in my mind, I wander the land
A bleak and dismal trance

Constrained, unsafe, left in shame
and now I can see my town is painted red
here forever I’ll be where once my tears were shed

On that day, in our place I recall the smell of the rain
and I’d protect you from them if you want me to take,
take you there again

Good night my love, let me watch, you sleep from here or above
Words like these won’t leave this place
Be haunted by our trace, the trace of our…
HOME
The home they want call their own
But for the air that I breathe, the dreams are divine
the memories I’ll bring to

A place far from home
The home they want to call province of Rome
I’m trapped without guards, within a state I can’t grasp
But we’re still free

I am waiting for the clouds to part, all in vain
Nature forsaken
Once admired by us all, does it know we’re scared
Scared to move, scared to wake, scared just to be who we were
What matters is just you and me and the path that leads us…

Encircled by friends, the pressure deepens
Dazed by illusions, my reason weakens
But I won’t let you fall into deep forlornness
I won’t let you ponder the why in distress
A mechanical smile as I lift my face towards the sun
And return to denial

I weep as I kiss the ground, the trees that I’ll soon miss
The songs we sang will ring out, the memories will resound

Life and death strung together like the mountains and valleys in which we lived.
There was wealth and opulence, but also tribulation and loss.
There was laughter and ong, and there was also tears.

But even more than tears, blood was shed.
And so many were left to their unadorned graves, unburied.
But to us, death was but another journey.
And close by the darkness through which we strode, there was also light.
The Light of life and immortality.

And after all, when I reminisce about those years, I mostly remember our songs.
We sang as if to drown out the sound of clashing swords,
as if the battle cries fell silent.
Because war had lost its meaning.

Glimmered on the roof of our homestead
We bode the nightfall at hand
Belive set out into the dark

In this night the fires roared
As fields were set ablaze
It rained ash from the sky
In a flaring hiss at night

Forward the land we knew
Off to far and distant shores
A safe haven
Off to these Santonian Shores

At the set of the sun
As mist billowed over the land
We got under way
Wandering, towards our hopes
I bode awhile and looked back
Gaued into the sea of flames
laying waste what we called home
I won’t see this place again

A cortege as far as the eye can see
A vast migrant parade
The glow of a distant dream
the awakening came nigh
under a starlit sky
Dreams within our hearts
Step by step we marched
Away into the night

837,The Siege,Eluveitie,"Scorched earth we left
A barren land of ash
Our fatherland laid waste
Be the void our fucking monument

At a leaden dawn
At this ominous morn

Pila loomed on the horizon
Talons of the wolverine
Exanimate legions formed
At the very gates of Avaricum
Believed invulnerable
This calling wall
But straight out of nowhere
Before our eyes this godsdawn bane arose

Thus Avaricum burns
Under a dead sky
Avaricum drowns
In blood and demise

Siege towers emerged
Protruding from the ground
Standing out against the threatening sky
As if to mock all valiantness
Face to face with an eye-leveled enemy
Serried roman ranks
Embattled upon our hold

Cut off and trapped inside
As the carnage was at hand
As the creak of the winches extolled our doom
The slaughter befell Avaricum
Dead suffused the oppidum
Left to pillage, sack and rape
Avaricum the brave became Avaricum the grave

838,The Uprising,Eluveitie,"Our estates are under fire
Our villagers fall prey to pillage

Time has come to take up arms again
The last call to rise up

Bestir
This is the flash of our last hope
Will you ally with us?
Wake up - open your eyes
Reach out
And seize this golden venture
We’ve lost ourselves in strife
While the raptor unopposedly
claws at Gallia’s free lands
We have to call a halt this
Unite the tribes and rise
Take a look around yourself
And see this time is ours
The last call to rise up

Our lands are under fire
Our villagers fall prey to pillage
How can we stay on the sideline
How long will we take this lying down?
It is time to join forces
Let the eagles beak burst on our shields
Unite! This is Gallia uprising!

The things we’ve seen
The deaths we died
The tears we cried
We will never regret
We defied
We will raise our arm stubs in pride
We will never perish

Our cut off hands
Proclaimed grandeur
Land can be taken but
Dignity’s impregnable

Uxellodunon
Fortress of free men
Shining beacon of indomitably

Bearing witness of freedom
Bearing witness of our names,
Cause we will never…

Out from the graves

841,From Darkness,Eluveitie,"Is it not ironic how your favorite dread is the matrix in which you were formed?
The unfathomable dark of a realm arcane and burrowed far below

The grain sprouts from deep beneath the soil
Where sunlight will never, ever, ever reach

Behold, from darkness we come
That shelter where all life is formed
Ascend, to darkness, we sail
Eternal refuge of the soul

The darkness of night goes out when dawn befalls in the time between the times
And the grain in the soil, buried deep, shall not bear fruit unless it dies
In the dark of Antumnos, the Awen waves and life is conceived

Behold, from darkness we come
That shelter where all life is formed
Ascend, to darkness, we sail
Eternal refuge of the soul

The day is born from the night
In the three night of Samon, the year is born
So the song has been sung, let him hear it, who will

Is it not ironic how you cling so hard to all evidence of all there is
As you maintain your unbroken urge to explain what you can’t?

The child grows in its mother’s womb
Enshrouded and concealed

Behold, from darkness we come
That shelter where all life is formed
Ascend, to darkness, we sail
Eternal refuge of the soul

Not one is forgotten
Every single one is just one more in Sucellus’ hand
Infinitesimal and evanescent, infinitesimal and evanescent

Distant echoes ring out, exalting the unseen
Ancient mountains serenely bode the vast
All deriding the pompous futile that will be burnt to ashes and be washed away

Is it sempiternal, yet sanctifying
Waters and fires are to come

Every single, every single one is numbered
Not one is forgotten
Every single one is just one more in Sucellus’ hand

They teach that the soul does not descend to the silent land of Erebus and the sunless realm of Dis below
But that the same breath still governs the limbs in a different world
If their tale be true, death is but a point in the midst of perpetual life

The ephemeral will fade, the futile will be washed away
Wounds will be healed and questions will be answered
Creation cleansed for a brand new day

Evanescent, minor and small
Insignificant, will become a little star to shine for those to come, for those to come

The ancient one stepped forth
To bring to justice the grim tyrants

Divine Logos upon him
His words alike the arrows in his quiver

Our ears tethered to the divine tongue
The ancient wise of Antumnos

Our burning strength - our beacon light - our freedom’s drown

On the day of strife
Two daughters born in pain
To the reign of life
Their dawning glory will shine

""Seseroneos! Ferocious giant o Tauriscus! You wroth bull
Long enough have you trampled over these lands!""
A raddled aged man

As lifeless demons without soul
These insentient hosts abide
Engulfing war monger get away from here!

Trod ye the path of vast deceit?
Every piece of evidence was a lie
The war, the threat’s a hyping fake
To move figures on the board!

Stain Bibracte’s ground!

What do you see in me?
Do you breathe-in dreams?
What spurred you to come here?
An oneiric picture of being…

Like disaffected legions taken, lure
I wonder what lies, what threat or promise
Persuaded them to leave their home that far away
…did they really know?

As the carnyx roared aloud
I quaked not, yet just asked myself
How their hearts took the bait,
These sweetened words of bitter essence

Face to face with nameless foes
Scorching words, unspoken lorn
Unheard quests remain the ashes of the dead

Upright in life or in death
Yet still the countless cries echo
In silenced caves of nothing

It’s like bearing in pain
Like embracing life and decaying in death
Heed, it’s like calling the rain
It’s like the caress of a mother
Like life to go withered, a perennial pneuma

The glory primal, the rapturous supremacy
Vanquishing the vile
Burgeoning beyond, bearing the essence of life

A way to say I need you more
You need to stay

You'll see me again
Is it right or wrong?
You'll see me again
We go on and on
It's worth the wait
And all this time I've had to change
You'll see me again
I know it won't be long

When it's hard to break it's hard to take
And the reasons why I never made it through
And I never gave you all the things that I wanted to
If I let you go and I walk away for reasons I will never know
I break
You pray

You'll see me again
Is it right or wrong?
You'll see me again
We go on and on
It's worth the wait
And all this time I've had to change
You'll see me again
I know it won't be long

But you won't love a ghost
I don't and I feel you in my throat
Another taste of love
You'll never know
Never wait for it 'and now the hand you hold
Is now the hand that holds you down

You'll see me again
Is it right or wrong?
You'll see me again
We go on and on
It's worth the wait
And all this time I've had to change
You'll see me again

This isn't courage
This isn't how you're supposed to be
And all the things keeping you awake
Are leaving me afraid
This isn't war
This isn't courage
And I don't believe that you're okay
The reason why I forget to close my eyes
When you're next to me
I feel you're going to leave

When birthdays are suicide days
And waking up it's hard to stay
I want to see you when you come down
So save yourself for me
I want to see you when you come down
So save yourself

The weight of loves forever trying
And it's enough to bury me
All the things keeping you awake
Are leaving finally

When birthdays are suicide days
And waking up it's hard to stay
I want to see you when you come down
So save yourself for me
I want to see you when you come down
So save yourself

Always said the same way I'm okay
Always walk away in chains
You know we wish you'd come around
Because nothing's changed
But it doesn't feel the same

I want to see you when you come down
So save yourself for me

So save yourself

I ain't a bad man
You could say that I am still my mother's son.
And I ain't seeing red
I am seeing everything I never was

And you can let em' know I took what I was looking for
And you can let em' know I took it cause' they couldn't, no

I played the wrong hand on the other hand I played it right
And I'm taking up a throne that was already ready already mine

Even if you say my name

The will to say
The filth that I became

I'm losing you are the reasons I can't hide

Everything was moving fast
Keeping pace with planes above
Nothing ever seems to last
I'm sorry you can't see where I'm running from
I hope to get away
Forget the way I sing the same old songs
But I always sing along

When all is said and done
On the run it's not where I want to be
No, it'll all remain the same if I change
You'll see oh my love is it ever enough?
Because everybody seem to feel the same
And I don't know if I have a line
A line to make you want to wait
So now I'm guilt stricken silent with my head on the floor
And I'll never be the same
So to get away forget the way I play
The same old songs and make the same mistakes

When all is said and done
On the run it's not where I want to be
No, it'll all remain the same if I change
You'll see me when it's done

And I'm learning not to love
Part of me going through emotions I can't show
Going through the motions of regret
I let go
And I'm learning I'm alone suddenly living in the moment
You both know you're falling from the same tight rope

Heading to Champaign
I passed right through a country
With a gorge as high as any

He said ""Excuse me sir I think I've lost my way""
Then I told him as I pulled back
On the road and headed south

875,Like Toy Soldiers,Eminem,"Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
We all fall down…

Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
We all fall down like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart, we never win
But the battle wages on for toy soldiers

I’m supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure
Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
I ain’t never supposed to show it, my crew ain’t supposed to know it
Even if it means goin’ toe to toe with a Benzino it don’t matter

I’d never drag them in battles that I can handle unless I absolutely have to
I’m supposed to set an example
I need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide ’em
If some shit ever just pop off, I’m supposed to be beside ’em

Now the Ja shit I tried to squash it, it was too late to stop it
There’s a certain line you just don’t cross and he crossed it
I heard him say Hailie’s name on a song and I just lost it
It was crazy, this shit be way beyond some Jay-Z and Nas shit

And even though the battle was won, I feel like we lost it
I spent too much energy on it, honestly I’m exhausted
And I’m so caught in it I almost feel I’m the one who caused it
This ain’t what I’m in hip-hop for, it’s not why I got in it

That was never my object for someone to get killed
Why would I wanna destroy something I helped build?
It wasn’t my intentions, my intentions was good
I went through my whole career without ever mentionin’ it

Now it’s just out of respect for not runnin’ my mouth
And talkin’ about something that I knew nothing about
Plus Dre told me stay out, this just wasn’t my beef
So I did, I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth

While he’s all over TV down talkin’ a man
Who literally saved my life, like ""Fuck it, I understand""
This is business and this shit just isn’t none of my business
But still knowin’ this shit could pop off at any minute ’cause

Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
We all fall down like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart, we never win
But the battle wages on for toy soldiers

There used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme
And wouldn’t have to worry about one of your people dyin’
But now it’s elevated ’cause once you put someone’s kids in it
The shit gets escalated, it ain’t just words no more is it?

It’s a different ball game, callin’ names and you ain’t just rappin’
We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happenin’
Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him
And asked him not to start it he wasn’t gonna go after him

Until Ja started yappin’ in magazines how we stabbed him
Fuck it 50 smash ’em, mash ’em, and let him have it
Meanwhile my attention is pulled in another direction
Some receptionist at The Source who answers phones at his desk

Has an erection for me and thinks that I’ll be his resurrection
Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record
But now he’s fucked the game up ’cause one of the ways I came up
Was through that publication, the same one that made me famous

Now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin’
Well fuck it, that mutherfucker can get it too, fuck him then
When I’m so busy being pissed off I don’t stop to think
That we just inherited 50’s beef with Murder Inc.

And he’s inherited mine which is fine ain’t like either of us mind
We still have soldiers that’s on the front line
That’s willing to die for us as soon as we give the orders
Never to extort us, strictly to show they support us

We’ll maybe shout ’em out in a rap or up in a chorus
To show them we love ’em back and let ’em know how important it is
To have Runyon Avenue soldiers up in our corners
Their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is

But I ain’t tryna have none of my people hurt or murdered
It ain’t worth it, I can’t think of a perfecter way to word it
Than to just say that I love ya’ll too much to see the verdict
I’ll walk away from it all before I let it go any further

But don’t get it twisted, it’s not a plea that I’m coppin’
I’m just willin’ to be the bigger man if y’all can quit poppin’
Off at your jaws with the knockin’ ’cause frankly I’m sick of talkin’
I’m not gonna let someone else’s coffin rest on my conscience ’cause

Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
We all fall down like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart, we never win
But the battle wages on for toy soldiers

876,Mockingbird,Eminem,"Yeah, I know sometimes, things may not always make sense to you right now
But hey, what daddy always tell you?
Straighten up little soldier, stiffen up that upper lip
What you crying about?
You got me

Hailie, I know you miss your mom, and I know you miss your dad
When I’m gone, but I’m trying to give you the life that I never had
I can see you’re sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside, you want to cry

’Cause you’re scared; I ain’t there? Daddy’s with you in your prayers
No more crying, wipe them tears; daddy’s here, no more nightmares
We gon’ pull together through it, we gon’ do it
Laney uncle’s crazy, ain’t he? Yeah, but he loves you girl and you better know it

We’re all we got in this world When it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls two little beautiful girls
Lookin’ puzzled, in a daze. I know it’s confusin’ you
Daddy’s always on the move; mama’s always on the news

I try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
All the things growing up his daddy that he had to see
Daddy don’t want you to see, but you see just as much as he did

We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have gotten so bad between us, I don’t see us ever being together
Ever again, like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then of course everything always happens for a reason

I guess it was never meant to be
But it’s just something we have no control over, and that’s what destiny is
But no more worries, rest your head, and go to sleep
Maybe one day we’ll wake up, and this will all just be a dream

Now hush little baby, don’t you cry
Everything’s gonna be all right
Stiffen that upper lip up little lady, I told ya
Daddy’s here to hold ya through the night

I know mommy’s not here right now, and we don’t know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise mama’s gon’ be all right

It’s funny, I remember back one year, when daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up and stuck ’em under the tree
And said some of ’em were from me, ’cause daddy couldn’t buy ’em
I’ll never forget that Christmas; I sat up the whole night crying

’Cause daddy felt like a bum, see daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
And at the time, every house that we lived in either kept getting broke into and robbed or shot up on the block

And your mom was saving money for you in a jar
Tryma start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars, till someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad, it broke your mama’s heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin’ to fall apart

Mom and dad was arguin’ a lot, so mama moved back
On the Chalmers in the flat—one bedroom apartment
And dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And that’s when daddy went to California with his CD
And met Dr. Dre and flew you and mama out to see me

But daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me
Then you started seeing daddy on the TV
And mama didn’t like it and you and Laney were to young to understand it
Papa was a Rollin’ Stone, momma developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I’m just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand

’Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I’m sittin’ in this empty house
Just reminiscing lookin’ at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown, it’s almost like you’re sisters now

Wow, guess you pretty much are and, daddy’s still here
Laney I’m talkin’ to you too: Daddy’s still here
I like the sound of that, yeah; it’s got a ring to it, don’t it?
Shh, mama’s only gone for the moment

Now hush little baby, don’t you cry
Everything’s gonna be all right
Stiffen that upper lip up little lady, I told ya
Daddy’s here to hold ya through the night

I know mommy’s not here right now, and we don’t know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise mama’s gon’ be all right

And if you ask me, too, daddy’s gonna buy you a mockingbird
I’mma give you the world
I’mma buy a diamond ring for you, I’mma sing for you
I’ll do anything for you to see you smile

And if that mockingbird don’t sing and that ring don’t shine
I’mma break that birdie’s neck
I’d go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every karat; don’t fuck with dad (haha)

And I can’t see at all
And even if I could it’ll all be gray, but your picture on my wall

Dear Slim, I wrote but you still ain’t callin’
I left my cell, my pager and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not’a got ’em
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin’

Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot ’em
But anyways; fuck it, what’s been up? Man, how’s your daughter?
My girlfriend’s pregnant too, I’m ’bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I’mma call her? I’mma name her Bonnie

I read about your Uncle Ronnie, too, I’m sorry.
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn’t want him
I know you probably hear this everyday, but I’m your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam

I got a room full of your posters and your pictures man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus too; that shit was phat!

Dear Slim, you still ain’t called or wrote, I hope you have a chance
I ain’t mad, I just think it’s fucked up you don’t answer fans
If you didn’t wanna talk to me outside your concert
You didn’t have to, but you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew

That’s my little brother man, he’s only six years old
We waited in the blistering cold for you, four hours and you just said, ""No""
That’s pretty shitty man, you’re like his fuckin’ idol
He wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than I do

I ain’t that mad though, I just don’t like bein’ lied to
Remember when we met in Denver, you said if I’d write you
You would write back, see I’m just like you in a way
I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her

I can relate to what you’re saying in your songs
So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put ’em on
’Cause I don’t really got shit else so that shit helps when I’m depressed
I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest

Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It’s like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See everything you say is real, and I respect you cause you tell it
My girlfriend’s jealous ’cause I talk about you twenty-four/seven

But she don’t know you like I know you Slim, no-one does
She don’t know what it was like for people like us growin’ up
You gotta call me man, I’ll be the biggest fan you’ll ever lose

This’ll be the last package I ever send your ass!
It’s been six months and still no word, I don’t deserve it?
I know you got my last two letters; I wrote the addresses on ’em perfect

So this is my cassette I’m sending you, I hope you hear it
I’m in the car right now, I’m doing 90 on the freeway
Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?
You know the song by Phil Collins, In the Air of the Night?

About that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drowning?
But didn’t, then Phil saw it all, then at a show he found him?
That’s kinda how this is, you coulda rescued me from drowning
Now it’s too late, I’m on a thousand downers now, I’m drowsy

And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
I love you Slim, we coulda been together, think about it
You ruined it now, I hope you can’t sleep and you dream about it

And when you dream, I hope you can’t sleep and you scream about it
I hope your conscience eats at you and you can’t breathe without me
See Slim; shut up bitch! I’m tryin’ to talk!
Hey Slim, that’s my girlfriend screamin’ in the trunk

But I didn’t slit her throat, I just tied her up, see I ain’t like you
’Cause if she suffocates, she’ll suffer more and then she’ll die too
Well, gotta go, I’m almost at the bridge now - Oh, shit! I forgot!
How am I supposed to send this shit out?

My tea’s gone cold I’m wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can’t see at all
And even if I could it’ll all be gray, but your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it’s not so bad, it’s not so bad

Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I just been busy
You said your girlfriend’s pregnant now, how far along is she?
Look, I’m really flattered you would call your daughter that
And here’s an autograph for your brother, I wrote it on the Starter cap

I’m sorry I didn’t see you at the show, I musta missed you
Don’t think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what’s this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
I say that shit just clownin’ dogg; c’mon, how fucked up is you?

You got some issues Stan, I think you need some counselling
To help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some
And what’s this shit about us meant to be together?
That type of shit’ll make me not want us to meet each other!

I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself, I think that you’ll be doin’ just fine

If you relax a little, I’m glad I inspire you, but Stan
Why are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan
I just don’t want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick

Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk and she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape, but they didn’t say who it was to
Come to think of it, his name was… it was you!

It’s the return of the… ""Ah, wait, no way, you’re kidding

And expect them not to know what a woman’s clitoris is

Of course they’re gonna know what intercourse is by the time they hit fourth grade
They got the Discovery Channel, don’t they?
We ain’t nothing but mammals… well, some of us, cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes

But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there’s no reason that a man and another man can’t elope (eugh!)
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women wave your pantyhose; sing the chorus, and it goes

I’m Slim Shady, yes I’m the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won’t the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

’Cause Slim Shady, yes I’m the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won’t the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

Will Smith don’t gotta cuss in his raps to sell records
Well I do, so fuck him and fuck you, too
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?
Half o’ you critics can’t even stomach me, let alone stand me

""But Slim, what if you win, wouldn’t it be weird?""
Why, so you guys can just lie to get me here?
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Yo shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs

So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear ’em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch put me on blast on MTV
""Yeah he’s cute, but I think he’s married to Kim, hehe""

I should download her audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD (ahh!)
I’m sick of you little girl and boy groups; all you do is annoy me
So I have been sent here to destroy you

And there’s a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me, who just don’t give a fuck like me
Who dress like me, walk, talk, and act like me
And just might be the next best thing but not quite me

’Cause I’m Slim Shady, yes I’m the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won’t the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

’Cause I’m Slim Shady, yes I’m the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won’t the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

I’m like a head trip to listen to, ’cause I’m only giving you
Things you joke about with your friends, inside your livin’ room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y’all
And I don’t gotta be false or sugar-coat it all

I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it (rip), I just shit it
Better than ninety percent of you rappers out can
Then you wonder how can kids eat up these albums like Valiums

It’s funny, ’cause at the rate I’m going, when I’m thirty
I’ll be the only person in the nursin’ home flirting
Pinchin’ nurses asses, while I’m jackin’ off with Jergens
And I’m jerkin’, but this whole bag of Viagra isn’t workin’

In every single person there’s a Slim Shady lurkin’
Who could be workin’ at Burger King, spittin’ on your onion rings
Or in the parking lot circling, screamin’ ""I don’t give a fuck""
With his windows down and his system up

So will the real Shady please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?

’Cause I’m Slim Shady, yes I’m the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won’t the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

’Cause I’m Slim Shady, yes I’m the real Shady

So won’t the real Slim Shady please stand up

879,Rap God,Eminem,"Look, I was gonna go easy on you, not to hurt your feelings
But I’m only going to get this one chance
Something’s wrong, I can feel it (Six minutes, Slim Shady, you’re on)
Just a feeling I’ve got, like something’s about to happen, but I don’t know what
If that means what I think it means, we’re in trouble – big trouble
And if he is bananas as you say, I’m not taking any chances
You are just what the doctor ordered

I’m beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slapbox, slapbox?
They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rapbot

But for me to rap like a computer must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen’ll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit

Made a living and a killing off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feeling on his nut-sack
I’m an MC still as honest

But as rude and indecent as all hell
Syllables skill-a-holic (Kill ’em all with)
This slickety-gippety-hippity-hip-hop
You don’t really wanna get into a pissing match with this rappity-rap
Packing a Mack in the back of the Ac, backpack rap, yap-yap, yacketty-yack

And now at the exact same time
I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I’m practicing that
I’ll still be able to break a motherfuckin’ table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half

Only realized it was ironic I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs, feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are having a rough time period, here’s a maxi-pad
It’s actually disastrously bad for the wack
While I’m masterfully constructing this masterpiece, yeah

’Cause I’m beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slapbox, slapbox?
Let me show you maintaining this shit ain’t that hard, that hard

Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like I have got
Well, to be truthful the blueprint’s simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the earth like an asteroid, I did nothing but shoot for the moon since
*pew*

MCs get taken to school with this music
’Cause I use it as a vehicle to bust the rhyme
Now I lead a new school full of students
Me? I’m a product of Rakim, Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N-
-W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren, Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim

Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up, and be in a position
To meet Run-D.M.C. and induct them into the motherfuckin’ Rock n’
Roll Hall of Fame
Even though I’ll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of shame
You fags think it’s all a game till I walk a flock of flames
Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinking?
Little gay looking boy

So gay I can barely say it with a straight face looking boy
You witnessing a massacre
Like you watching a church gathering take place looking boy
Oy vey, that boy’s gay, that’s all they say looking boy
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
And a way to go from your label everyday looking boy
Hey, looking boy, what you say looking boy?
I get a ""hell yeah"" from Dre looking boy
I’mma work for everything I have
Never asked nobody for that shit, get outta my face looking boy
Basically boy you’re never gonna be capable
Of keeping up with the same pace looking boy

’Cause I’m beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
The way I’m racing around the track, call me Nascar, Nascar
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod this planet’s Krypton, no Asgard, Asgard

So you be Thor and I’ll be Odin, you rodent, I’m omnipotent
Let off then I’m reloading immediately with these bombs I’m totin’
And I should not be woken
I’m the walking dead, but I’m just a talking head, a zombie floating
But I got your mom deep throating

I’m out my Ramen noodle, we have nothing in common, poodle
I’m a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
It’s me, my honesty’s brutal
But it’s honestly futile if I don’t utilize what I do though

For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle
Enough rhymes to maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines just in case ’cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry looking at me like it’s lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground, but I still rap like I’m on my Pharoahe Monch grind

So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come trying to censor you
Like that one line I said on ""I’m Back"" from The Mathers LP
One where I tried to say I’d take seven kids from Columbine
Put ’em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a nine
See if I get away with it now that I ain’t as big as I was, but I’m

Morphin’ into an immortal coming through the portal
You’re stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
And I don’t know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You’re pointless as Rapunzel with fucking cornrows
You write normal, fuck being normal
And I just bought a new raygun from the future

To just come and shoot ya like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
’Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Maywhether’s pad
Singin’ to a man while he played piano
Man, oh, man, that was the 24/7 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station the very next day
""Hey, Fab, I’mma kill you""
Lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed, JJ Fad

Uh, sama lamaa duma lamaa you assuming I’m a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you I’m superhuman
Innovative and I’m made of rubber
So that anything you say is ricocheting off of me and it’ll glue to you
I’m devastating, more than never demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin’ audience a feeling like it’s levitating
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they’ll be celebrating
’Cause I know the way to get ’em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
Oh, he’s too mainstream
Well, that’s what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
It’s not hip-hop, it’s pop, ’cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on Lose Yourself and make ’em lose it

I don’t know how to make songs like that
I don’t know what words to use
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I’m ripping any one of these verses diverse as you
It’s curtains, I’m inadvertently hurtin’ you
How many verses I gotta murder to prove
That if you were half as nice, your songs and you could sacrifice virgins too

School flunky, pill junky
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself ’cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I’m a million leagues above you, ill when I speak in tongues
But it’s still tongue and cheek, fuck you
I’m drunk so Satan take the fucking wheel, I’m asleep in the front seat
Bumping Heavy D. & the Boys, still chunky, but funky
But in my head there’s something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils and here’s what they want from me

They asking me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred that I had
Then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination

But fuck it, life’s handing you lemons, make lemonade then
But if I can’t batter the women how the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?
Don’t mistake it for Satan
It’s a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas
And take a vacation to trip a broad
And make her fall on her face and don’t be a retard
Be a king? Think not
Why be a king when you can be a God?

Nothing can fix the buildings flawed foundations
But scaffolding and stilts were the laws and legislation
This house was doomed but they didn’t care
They invested in a system that was beyond repair

When I was little
I dressed up as an astronaut and explored outter space
I dressed up as a super hero and ran about the place
I dressed up as a fireman and rescued those in need
I dressed up as a doctor and cured every disease

It was crystal clear to me back then
That the only problems that I could face
Would be the same problems that effect us all

But of course this sense of common existence
Was sucked out of me in an instance
As though from birth I could walk but I was forced to crawl

So this is such exciting times

To survive

There’s something in the air tonight
Something is wrong, spit it out!

He says, meaning misfortune
""I’m beginning to get glimpses of what is called real life
Yes, they’re lost in myopia. Yes, they’re lost in myopia""

Surrounded by ostriches with mouths full of sand
Their teeth grind the grains, but their faces don’t contort
Perplexed, I am unable to breathe in their skin
We are all vertebrates but where is that backbone now?

""I’m beginning to get glimpses of what is called real life""

Is an appliance that emancipates us from dogma

Mean we got to dissolve unchecked tradition
But atrocities go untouched under the guise of culture
Committed on another mind another heartbeat

stakeholders of this planet, this floating rock we call Earth.
Alas, that means you.
That means everyone of your acquaintance,
every figure your eyes skim past in the street,
every charlatan still to defeat,
every tender face you find solace in -
now mimic the mindset William Wallace was in.
Dismount, disembark, descend from your existence,
slacken your angst and decant your hate
’cause in the long run they’re about as useful
as pouring acid onto your dinner plate.
To muzzled masses that lead lives of deafening desperation:
With Excalibur aloft King Arthur earned the throne
but it’s our minds we gotta wrench out of stone.
Don’t be fooled by its simplicity, there was never a broadcast made of such urgency
’cause at no time before us did we grasp the scope of this emergency.
Ladle out love and logic by the boatload,
equipped with that cargo you can take any road.
Now grab life, seize time. this fight is for human kind.

I am a mindsweeper, focus on me.
I am a mindsweeper, focus on me.
I will read your mind.

I dart through rapids, through the streams of thought,
then suddenly I started losing my mind.
Catapulting through the uncharted
I could no longer tell if these were your thoughts or mine.

And it was as if I held a mirror up to my soul, held a mirror up to my soul.
It was as if I held a mirror up to my soul.
Who was the author and who was the observer?
Who was the author and who was the observer?
For at the last analysis our thoughts coalesced.

You are not alone. You are not alone.

You have entered volatile territory,
you have started a journey, you’re part of this story.
And this, this was just a glimpse, just a glimpse.
You’ve no idea what you’ve got yourself into.

Through the plains of adversity and the ravines of neurosis
Through the veins of gods and the valley of death

And we dance like knights

Here come the cavalry
Here come the cavalry
Oh am I glad to see your face

Sorry you’re not a winner
With the air so cold and a mind so bitter
Take it away, boys!

I’m in the mood

in an elevator stuck between stories.
I always find myself in the middle of your stories.

With the cameras as a witness I will suffer!

If everything I do is wrong then, by God, I’ll do it right.

We don’t dance no, no, no…
We got class!
No, we don’t have any fun at all.
It’s the new style and we know it!
We’re not stunning, we’re just stunned!

We’re lying for a living!

Don’t you know who I am?
I’m the real thing with low-key sensibilities.
I don’t need what I’ve got,
half as much as everyone covets it!

Well, if loving me is wrong then goddamn you do it right.

It turns us on to turn you down!
We’re turned on to turn you down!

Knew arithmetic so well
Working overtime
Completed what was assigned
We had to multiply ourselves

A shiny copper penny

And he spent himself
Would not listen to us
But when he lost his appetite
He lost his weight in friends

Baby became a fat nickel so fast

Then came puberty
Exponentially
Soon our boy became a million

People loved him so
And helped him to grow
Everyone knew the thing that was best
Of course, he must invest

Resolution slips away again
Right through my fingers, back into my heart
Where it’s out of reach and it’s in the dark

Sometimes I think I’m blind
Or I may be just paralyzed

Because the plot thickens every day
And the pieces of my puzzle keep crumblin’ away
But I know, there’s a picture beneath

Indecision clouds my vision
No one listens…

Because I’m somewhere in between
Of my love and of my agony
You see, I’m somewhere in between

My life is falling to pieces
Somebody put me together

Layin’ face down on the ground
My fingers in my ears to block the sound
My eyes shut tight to avoid the sight
Anticipating the end, losing the will to fight

Droplets of “yes” and “no”
In an ocean of “maybe”

From the bottom, it looks like a steep incline
From the top, another downhill slope of mine
But I know, the equilibrium’s there

Indecision clouds my vision
No one listens…

Because I’m somewhere in between
My love and my agony
You see, I’m somewhere in between

It is the real thing
The essence of the truth

The perfect moment
That golden moment
I know you feel it too

I know the feeling
It is the real thing
You can’t refuse the embrace

No!

It’s like the pattern below the skin
You gotta reach out and pull it all in
And you feel like you’re too close
So you swallow another dose

The pinnacle of happiness
Filling up your soul
You don’t think you can take any more
You never wanna let go

To touch the roots of experience
The most basic ingredients
To see the unseen glitter of life
And feel the dirt, grief, anger and strife

Cherish the certainly of now
It kills you a bit at a time
Cradle the inspiration
It will leave you writhing on the floor

This is so unreal, what I feel
This nourishment, life is bent
Into a shape I can hold
A twist of fate, all my own
Just grit your teeth, make no sound
Take a step away and look around
Just clench your fist and close your eyes
Look deep inside, hypnotize
The whisper is but a shout
That’s what it is all about
Yes, the ecstasy, you can pray
You will never let it slip away

Like the sacred song that someone sings through you (through you)
Like the flesh so warm that the thorn sticks into (into)
Like the dream you know one day will come to life (life)
Try to hold on just a little longer (longer), stronger (stronger)

It’s the jewel of victory
The chasm of misery
And once you have bitten the core
You will always know the flavor

The split second of divinity
You drink up the sky
All of heaven is in your arms
You know the reason why

It’s right there, all by itself
And what you are, there is nothing else
You’re growing a life within a life
The lips of wonder kiss you inside

And when it’s over the feeling remains
It all comes down to this
The smoke clears, I see what it is
That made me feel this way

I know the feeling
It is the real thing
The essence of the truth

The perfect moment
That golden moment
I know you feel it too

I know the feeling
It is the real thing
You can’t refuse the embrace

This is so unreal, what I feel
Flood, sell your soul, feel the blood
Pump through your veins, can’t explain
The element that’s everything
Just clench your fist and close your eyes
Look deep inside, hypnotize
Yes, the ecstasy, you can pray
You will never let it slip away
Yes, the ecstasy, you can pray
You will never let it slip away
You will never let it slip away
You will never let it slip away

Like the echoes of your childhood laughter, ever after
Like the first time love urged you to take its guidance, in silence
Like your heartbeat when you realize you’re dying, but you’re trying
Like the way you cry for a happy ending (ending, ending, ending, ending, ending)

(I know the feeling)

Look at me, look at me
Hands in the air like it's good to be
Alive, and I'm a famous rapper
Even when the paths are all crookedy

I can show you how to do-si-do
I can show you how to scratch a record
I can take apart the remote control
And I can almost put it back together

I can tie a knot in a cherry stem
I can tell you about Leif Ericson
I know all the words to ""De Colores""
And ""I'm Proud to Be an American""

Me and my friend saw a platypus
Me and my friend made a comic book
And guess how long it took
I can do anything that I want, 'cause, look

I can keep rhythm with no metronome
No metronome
No metronome
And I can see your face on the telephone
On the telephone
On the telephone

Look at me, look at me
Just called to say that it's good to be
Alive in such a small world
I'm all curled up with a book to read

I can make money, open up a thrift store
I can make a livin' off a magazine
I can design an engine
Sixty-four miles to a gallon of gasoline

I can make new antibiotics
I can make computers survive aquatic conditions,
I know how to run the business
And I can make you wanna buy a product

Movers, shakers and producers
Me and my friends understand the future
I see the strings that control the system
I can do anything with no resistance

'Cause I can lead a nation with a microphone
With a microphone
With a microphone
And I can split the atoms of a molecule
Of a molecule
Of a molecule

Look at me, look at me
Drivin' and I won't stop
And it feels so good to be alive and on top
My reach, is global
My tower, secure
My cause, is noble
My power, is pure

I can hand out a million vaccinations
Or let 'em all die of exasperation
Have 'em all healed of their lacerations
Have 'em all killed by assassination

I can make anybody go to prison
Just because I don't like 'em
And I can do anything with no permission
I have it all under my command because

I can guide a missile by satellite
By satellite
By satellite
And I can hit a target through a telescope
Through a telescope
Through a telescope

And I can end the planet in a holocaust
In a holocaust

Nor the craters beneath the draped flags
Those hoods are there for your protection
And meteors these days are the size of corpses""

The night rolls in
You can feel it starting
All over again

The moon comes up
And the music calls
You’re getting tired of
Staring at the same four walls

You’re out of your room
And down on the street
Moving through the crowd
In the midnight heat

The traffic roars
And the sirens scream
You look at the faces
It’s just like a dream

Nobody knows where you’re going
Nobody cares where you’ve been

’Cause you belong to the city
You belong to the night
Living in a river of darkness
Beneath the neon light

You were born in the city
Concrete under your feet
It’s in your moves
It’s in your blood
You’re a man of the street

When you said goodbye
You were on the run
Trying to get away
From the things you’ve done

Now you’re back again
And you’re feeling strange
So much has happened
But nothing has changed

You still don’t know where you’re going
You’re still just a face in the crowd

You belong to the city
You belong to the night
Living in a river of darkness
Beneath the neon light

You were born in the city
Concrete under your feet
It’s in your blood
It’s in your moves
You’re a man of the street

You can taste it
You can see it
You can face it

Delivery is all the same
And when I look at you
I instinctively start the game

Start to weep and scream at me

Oh no, you’re ripping off my face again!

That I’ve built with my own hands
Can’t release the rage
Shattered life and broken plans

If I knew myself
I wouldn’t keep on doing this
But I trick myself
And believe with just one kiss

I can’t believe the things I do
All for the sake of pleasing you

In the dark again
Afraid to move but can’t sit still
Killed my heart again
To myself I give this pill

If I was myself
I’d find strength to push away
But I hurt myself
And I weaken more each day

I can’t believe the things I do
All for the sake of pleasing you

As I come to know you
My disgust grows anew
As you tighten your grip
My worn throat slowly slits

I can’t believe the things I do
All for the sake of pleasing you

I should just stop and let you know
But I’m afraid of letting go

Letting go

975,Afterthoughts,Godhead,"Sifting through the ashes of my life
I thought I found the one that I could always trust
Slowly I began to learn that I can never judge
The things that mean the most to me

And all the hate and anger they all put on you
You just threw on me

And I don’t believe that I could ever be with you
And I don’t believe that we could ever be together

Calling out to you, try to show the truth
But you just carry on
Killing everything that we once had
And never really understanding why

And I don’t believe that I could ever be with you
And I don’t believe that we could ever be together

You’ve taken everything and left me here with nothing
Taken everything and left me here with nothing
You’ve taken everything and left me here with nothing
Taken everything and left me here with nothing

You’ve taken everything and left me here with nothing
Taken everything and left me here with nothing

976,Alone,Godhead,"She waits patiently
Holding time for me
Tells me about herself

She writes everything
Up and down for me
Keeps it inside herself

As the deception reveals itself

My morality
A slave to gravity
My sanity has turned to agony

Can’t speak or convey
Secrets about herself

She holds all the things
That keep her lingering
I take her inside myself

My sanity has turned to agony

And glass cathedrals
Why don’t you come down from your cloud
And face reality?

I want, I love, I need, I breathe,
I lust, I trust, I cheat, I bleed

Behind the walls they built for you
You live your orchestrated life
Inside your heart you know it’s wrong
But you can’t stop it
Your soul it longs for something more
But never finds it
And so you blame me for it all
And choose another

I want, I love, I need, I breathe,
I lust, I trust, I cheat, I bleed

How about I step aside?
And let you do your thing again

If there’s nothing that can fool you
How come you’re all alone?
Anything can happen now

When you close your little eyes
They will plunder all your dreams
And take away your teddy bear

I guess you fucked it up
I guess you fucked it up this time

Monkey see and monkey do
Now what a fool are you
To do just what they told you to?

And now you know how roles can change
You used to be so out of range
For anything that brought you down

Every time you go to sleep
You get to feel how this runs so deep
Makes nightmares out of pretty dreams

I guess you fucked it up
I guess you fucked it up this time

I just wish there was something
That you could say
That could make me care again

Something that would make me want to get you out of this
But there is really nothing left
Of anything we’ve had

So now you’re on your own
So now you’re all alone
Just like you always wanted it to be

No one to tell you how to think
No one to tell you when to stop
No one to tell you when to think about the fact that you fucked up

That you fucked up
About the fact that you fucked up
That you fucked up
About the fact that you fucked up

That you fucked up again

They’re in control now and there’s nothing you can do
They’re in control now and there’s nothing you can do
They’re in control now and there’s nothing you can do

They’re in control now and there’s nothing you can do

Reflections that I can’t face

It never waits for me
If I could do it all one more time

You’re in ruins

Lay down your arms, give up the fight
One, 21 guns

When you’re at the end of the road
And you’ve lost all sense of control
And your thoughts have taken their toll
When your mind breaks the spirit of your soul

And the hangover doesn’t pass
Nothing’s ever built to last

Lay down your arms, give up the fight
One, 21 guns
Throw up your arms into the sky, you and I

Did you try to live on your own
When you burned down the house and home?
Did you stand too close to the fire
Like a liar looking for forgiveness from a stone?

When it’s time to live and let die
And you can’t get another try
Something inside this heart has died
You’re in ruins

A forced journey into an unknown future
As our doom eclipsed this clueless state,
I had to leave my world behind

Their hate was so outright,
It filled my heart with fright
I know only too well
My people chose to welcome tyranny,
The slaves of terror, murder, pain
Humanity lays dying once again

Their hate was so outright,
It filled my heart with fright
I know only too well,
I am an undead poet
Buried in no ground
I know only too well

""Die Heimat hat mir Treue nicht gehalten,
Sie gab sich ganz den bösen Trieben hin
Doch hier wird niemand meine Verse lesen,
Ist nichts, was meiner Seele Sprache spricht;
Ein deutscher Dichter bin ich einst gewesen,
Jetzt ist mein Leben ein Spuk wie mein Gedicht.""

Now here I am, disabled but alive
Where no one calls my name
Where nothing meets my soul
Now here I am, but cannot build my home
As no one reads my bitter words

I’m yearning for the day of my return
Yet nothing’s there to make my dreams come true
I know only too well,
I am a ghost wandering this world
I’m like a ghost, I know only too well

I see the distant flames
This outland holds no hope
As no one reads my truly bitter words

1028,Return To Sanity,Heaven Shall Burn,"An unforgiving chill crawls down my blood stained limbs
And a thousand frozen bodies line our way into the night
Shadows of dead trees appear like ghosts in poisoned clouds

Heart-wrenching cries agonize my soul
Hand to hand we fight
And man by man we die
No sanity is here to find, our god has left this hell
We’re wandering like shadows
Through frozen worlds

Once my mind was occupied,
Filled with heroic stories, all glorious tales about this war
But now I know there is no honor here to find
We’re marching endlessly, relentlessly, towards the end
A purgatory we walk through, a common grave for all of us
No matter friend or enemy, a forest of the dead

Heart-wrenching cries agonize my soul
Hand to hand we fight
And man by man we die
No sanity is here to find, our god has left this hell
We’re wandering like shadows
Through frozen worlds

I should not care about my enemies, tell me what have I become
My blackened heart’s still beating
All of a sudden I’m aware
Compassion is no weakness, compassion is no treason

Here we are, waiting for the storm to come.
We know this world will drown in blood.
Last days of May, this spring is dying once again,
But we sense this summer may not be ours anymore.
Within these walls, we’re loyal brothers,
Comrades till death.
Now in the distance we see the fires rage.
They will not take this place, will not defile this ground.
We’re not afraid to die, no one will break this line,
This darkened world will hear our cries.
This darkened world will hear our cries.
As clouds of dust contaminate the deep blue skies,
We’re crawling through the debris of our homes.
Here we are, waiting for the storm.

Now in the distance we see the fires rage.
They will not take this place, will not defile this ground.
We’re not afraid to die, no one will break this line,
This darkened world will hear our cries.
Curtain fires, lying in the trenches, buried deep
As cold ashes cover this swaying world in grey.
Inside this fortress, we’re faithful sisters,
Comrades till death.
As their bombs eclipse this sallow sun
And their guns annihilate our sanctuaries,
Our confidence, it will not vanish, not abate,
We will not cease resisting.
Now in the distance we see the fires rage.
They will not take this place, will not defile this ground.
We’re not afraid to die, no one will break this line,

Open your eyes and cast their lies aside

Your blinded leaders, they’re headed nowhere

I know they tell you to believe their truth
But I will never stand this pain
I know they say not to worry anymore
But I just cannot look away
The truth is plain, this truth is plain

Closing your eyes is nothing but surrender
How can you ask me if we can save this world
For them it died so many years ago
Get on your knees and greet the omen

How often did they prove their ignorance to you
How many times did they betray
The truth is plain, this truth is plain
Selling the hard-won values we archived

You know that nothing will ever break the beast
You know there are millions left for dead
But no one broadcasts their cries
And now you dare to ask me, if we can save this world
For them it died so many years ago
Get on your knees and greet the omen

Closing your eyes is nothing but surrender,
A rotten act of treason
Please never ask me, if we can save this world
For them it died so many years ago

A stomach full of pills didn’t work again
I’ll put a bullet in my head
And I’m gone, gone, gone, gone

Gone too far, yea I’m gone again
It’s gone on too long, tell you how it ends
I’m sitting on the edge with my two best friends
One’s a bottle of pills, and one’s a bottle of gin

I’m twenty stories up, yea up at the top
I polished off this bottle, now it’s pushing me off
Asphalt to me has never looked so soft
I bet my momma found my letter, now she’s calling the cops

I’ve got to take this opportunity before I miss it
’Cause now I hear the sirens and they’re off in the distance
Believe me when I tell you that I’ve been persistent
’Cause I’m more scarred, more scarred then my wrist is

I’ve been trying too long with too dull of a knife
But tonight I made sure that I sharpened it twice
I never bought a suit before in my life
But when you go to meet God, you know you want to look nice

So if I survive, then I’ll see you tomorrow
Yea I’ll see you tomorrow

My legs are dangling off the edge

We hit the sky, there goes the light
No more sun, why’s it always night?
When you can’t sleep, well you can’t dream
When you can’t dream well, what’s life mean?

We feel a little pity but don’t empathize
The old are getting older, watch a young man die
A mother and a son and someone you know
Smile at each other and realize you don’t

You don’t know what happened to that kid you raised
What happened to that father, who swore he’d stay
I didn’t know, ’cause you didn’t say
Now momma feels guilt, yea momma feels pain

When you were young, you never thought you’d die
Found out you could, but too scared to try
Looked in the mirror and you said goodbye
Climbed to the roof to see you if could fly

So if I survive, then I’ll see you tomorrow
Yea, I’ll see you tomorrow

My legs are dangling off the edge
The bottom of the bottle is my only friend
I think I’ll slit my wrists again
And I’m gone, gone, gone, gone

My legs are dangling off the edge
A stomach full of pills didn’t work again
I’ll put a bullet in my head

But the words you say, they always seem to fade out
Since you’ve been away, I’m just a face in the crowd
Someday, someday, I know you’re coming back

Down in the dirt with your blood on my hands
I blacked out, but now I do understand
That you were too good for this world so you left it
Everything turned red and then you made an exit
I don’t even know if it was your time
But like all good things that pass you by
It’s like a lost soul in the time of need
It made me grow up fast and put some blood on my knees
And you don’t even know what’s beyond you
Thinking you could never die like you’re bulletproof
So I guess you had to leave, you were born with wings
But you were never happy til the angels sing

I just can’t escape, it’s like you’re here with me now
But the words you say, they always seem to fade out
Since you’ve been away, I’m just a face in the crowd
Someday, someday, I know you’re coming back down
Someday, someday, I know you’re coming back down

I’m ashes to ashes, I’m dust to dust
And when a man turns to ashes, forget about love
Like the feeling inside you with the bottle beside you
You both end up empty like an angel just died too
I look to the heavens, to the sky and the rest
I looked inside myself, I felt my heart in my chest
Something so point blue, there’s nothing to say
Some hearts to stay true when falling away
Come lay down beside me, what you and I mean
It’s only what I’ve seen it’s only just one dream
Tell my baby I love her, and I wish I could hold her
It’s hard to say goodbye when you know that it’s over

I just can’t escape, it’s like you’re here with me now
But the words you say, they always seem to fade out
Since you’ve been away, I’m just a face in the crowd

As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I wear my crown of thorns and pull the knife from my chest
I keep searching for something that I never seem to find
But maybe I won’t because I left it all behind

Now I’m stuck with this and that’ll never change
Always a part of me until the very last day
Where to go from here, what road to travel on
I spent my whole life choosing and it always chose wrong

Will I try to have the will to be alive
Will I try ’cause I’ve never seen the light
Blow it to the ground and it’s now you see
You spent your whole life taking the best of me

Where’d you go
Where’s your home
How’d you end up all alone
Can you hear me now

There’s no light
There’s no sound
Hard to breathe when you’re underground
Can you hear me now
Hear me now

(Now now now now now)

How low can I keep pretending to be
That all the stars in the sky could mean something to me
Heaven will open up if I live on my knees
A man of many words but a man of few deeds

Walking these streets so absent of hope
A pillow of concrete, a man with no home
Lend him a hand then we’ll walk him the way
Leave the virtue of pity but we live with the shame

So scared to dream in a world with no sunlight
When you wake up you know it’s darker than last night
Quickly we forget, sacrifice gone by
Born to walk away, been walking my whole life

Where’d you go
Where’s your home
How’d you end up all alone
Can you hear me now

There’s no light
There’s no sound
Hard to breathe when you’re underground
Can you hear me now
Hear me now

Look into my eyes and I see
What do I see
Nothing at all (nothing at all)

What do I see

Every time I die, I hope they’re digging up my grave

While you gag on this rag, I see you all laughing so happily

It’s okay to get startled and be afraid of the dark
I’ll just wait here to swallow your soul and tear you apart
And I’ve already started, there ain’t no saving your heart

And a thousand candles burn into the night
When the angels softly cry, on the plains below the sky
Would a thousand souls still pray for you and I?

You can hide but some of us can never leave
And if you go I don’t need those little things

1044,I Love My Harbour,Hundreds,"While we walk through empty streets
You calmed our heart beats
We see them

Rocks and bushes fall apart
A fetal lost their path
We form
We lose

This desert it will never end
Our thirst is never filled
Let’s move on

Purple sky is above our heads
Illuminated aeroplanes
We run
They follow

We can try
Sure we die
But we can share
Some safety
Some fear

Memories and thoughts are gone
Brightest whitened minds
Don’t talk

I am watching windows
You pull the blindfolds down
We know it
We find it

Animals have left their homes
Trees grow upside down
We have our hands

We’ll hide inside a big fish
Listen to the choir
The seaside is waiting

We can try
For sure we die
But we can share
Some safety
Some fear

and pictured each other.

We are whitest sheets

Could you sit with me?
Under the icicles
Give me your trembling hands
I don’t wear kid gloves
This darkness is complete
Please don’t say a word

Oh we will stumble

Please tell me everything

On the birds of the flowers

But the wind is blowing, the wind is blowing

I will grow fast
The highest tree in the field
You bark up at last

In my lovely cave

And I am no longer possessed by my possessions, that have costs behind my eyes.
Exploitation of innocence.

We spit in their faces, to keep ours looking prime.
We starve them of their freedom, freedom, to feed our lavish lives.
We put a price on their worth, to finance our greed.

And you could have it all. My empire of dirt. I will let you down. I will make you hurt.

And if it crumbles, at least I know I tried. I can stand on that. Instead of questioning why…

""Give up yourself and you will find your real self. Lose your life and you will save it.""

""Even in literature or art no man who cares about originality will ever be original.
It’s the man who’s only thinking about doing a good job or telling the truth who becomes really original, but doesn’t notice it.
Even in social life, you never make a good impression on other people until you stop thinking what sort of impression you make.
That principle runs all through life from the top to the bottom.
Give up yourself and you will find your real self. Lose your life and you will save it.
Submit to death, submit with every fiber of your being and you will find eternal life.""

Throwing away the scraps and trying to restart.

My soul stormed until it stopped trying to shine.
It settled for hazy messages from a black sky.
I still don’t know why, know why.
No question I threw up, came back, and I don’t know why.
Is this what I wanted to be? A restless soul wrestling with what I believe.
Or just a selfish soul blind to problems that tower over me, over me, that tower over me.

Slow fade out. Sun burn and stay out. Clouds close like a mouth. ’Round last light and sound.
Don’t bother, save your breath. Could be the last you get.

Dreams never come when I feel this way. I am a victim to everything around me.
They present deceit, packaged with lies, and try to unravel my demise.

I have to drive them out of my life. Pull the trigger on oppression. I’m ready to fight.

Sometimes I feel like there’s no hope for mankind.
Strapped down to tradition, chained to the lies we’ve been fed.
Has this gone too far? Can we sever the hand of power hanging over our heads?

We can take them all. Let them line up against our generation that says no.
We’re not standing for this. We’re bringing you to your knees. Turn your back on everything.
To expose the lies and greed that you beg us to buy into.

And to her surprise he actually came home tonight.
But he’s still not acting right.

He knows better, but he’s never experienced it.
It’s a night much like when he was young.
Mama’s on the floor again
Yelling ""I love you""s at the man standing above her
Who can only respond with violence.
He notices the similarities, and begins to scream off the balcony:

""I will never be like you, I will always despise you.

About his distaste for his former kin.
His evil thoughts are pushing him to the edge
And now he’s flirting with that ledge.

Those green eyes look at him from behind,
She’s begging him to change his mind.
He shows his back to those that he loves,
When he dives headfirst into the earth.

He buries his head, hiding it from the world.
Then screams his little girl.

""I will always despise you.

I can’t go without letting my self down.

We, we cannot win alone.
We’re coming up dry, our necks flush.
We’ve been staring at our crowns.
We’ve abandoned something up above, something up above.

I am nothing without the men who walked before me.
I’m broken by my own pride, my self-hate.
Bring a plague to my pride.
Let me know: I am nothing.

I confess: I’m not the man I proclaim.

Into the mire beneath me, the mire, the mire beneath me.

I can’t help but notice the endless battle for air
While being swept by the tides of complacency.
My knowledge is accountability
And I have to do something, I have to do something.
Blinded by the plank in my eye,
I cannot guide anyone.

I have to do something.
I have to do something.

This lonely vessel is surely sinking,
I’m surely sinking.
I’m surely sinking.
I’m surely sinking.

if it means they die to themselves,
Only to raise up their new lives.
Stop me in my tracks if it will shake them.
Stop, stop me.

Yet the sea is never full.
The streams return again without an ounce of toil.
What has been, will be again, nothing new under the sun.
There is nothing new under the sun.

Lest the adversary misunderstand our hand.
Lest the adversary misunderstand, misundertand and say our hand has triumphed.

What has been will be again.
Nothing new under the sun.
What has been, will be again to exalt flesh.
What has been will be again.
Nothing new under the sun.
What has been will be done again to exalt flesh.

Lest the adversary misunderstand our hand.
Lest the adversary misunderstand, misunderstand and say our hand has triumphed.

My legacy will be too large for this soil.
My whole life I’ve been compared to those around me,
Expectations on my shoulder and people to please.

I will stand strong on my own.
When everyone lets me down,
I will stand strong alone,

I will no longer sway with the willows.
I will stand strong on my own.

To better what I am
You won’t hear lies from me

Feel a sudden haze
Time to get moving
Getting somewhere with no directions
I swear to you
It will never be the same
It’s not straight but the road lies open
Leaving all tears behind

I stand along and breath again
I won’t stop until this is through

And I can’t wait to see the sun rise again
It’s moments like this
I’m what you’ll never be
To better what I am
You won’t hear lies from me

And I can’t wait to see the sun rise again
It’s moments like this
I’m what you’ll never be
To better what I am
You won’t hear lies from me

Erase darkness from from my mind
Last remaining night
From here to everywhere

I stand along and breath again
I won’t stop until this is through

And I can’t wait to see the sun rise again

I’m what you’ll never be
To better what I am

That burning feeling
Let me go
This is real
Always one more thing
I clench my hands and bang my head

Take whatever comes to you
All the while,
I don’t need another friend

I burn when I do the things I do for you
Forever the night
It’s all for me now
I’m sure that one day
I can get you all that you lost

I never told
Blessed is the sick in me
I’m dying alone
We stand to fight for nothing
Without a thought, a reason
It will never be okay

I burn when I do the things I do for you
Forever the night
It’s all for me now
I’m sure that one day
I can get you all you lost

A growing pain
It’s hard to say what brought the darkest burden
For some of us there’s no answer

Chains are breaking
I won’t let this build up inside me
There’s a storm coming
But I’ll serve no more

Who’s at the helm?

Invented isolation
Alone and safe inside
Struggle with words
That make sense in time
Yet waiting for someone to enter

Say,
I have a better plan
I have a better plan
I have a better plan

Never have to worry
For all that we know
Truth be told
As we lay down low
Walking the thin line
Let the happiness in for now
It’s fine we’re living the lie

When light breaks
Another way to matter
All questions somehow answered
When life comes crushing
At the early break of day
We’ve only come so far

Never have to worry
For all that we know
Truth be told
As we lay down low
Walking the thin line
Let the happiness in for now
It’s fine we’re living the lie

I’m not eternity

Waiting for a final blow
Do you have strength at all?

Genetic codes of a dying breed

Staring into bright lights
I am what I’ve done
It’s useless to hide
An empty chamber
Guess I was part of a plan

Genetic codes of a dying breed

Can’t seem to recognize
What put us here in the first place

Light the way for me

Last candle burns and I’m dying inside
All of this will turn to ash
A change for a peace of mind

These are shores I left behind
Streets were getting smaller and I had to leave

All I hear is noise
Hearts of false hope
Guess I took it all for granted

Feels so cold that I shake, every time I reflect.
These stories I’m writing to verse they sure do serve my thirst.
Seems to clear my head, when I’m awake at night.
I pull myself so tight, lying in the dark.
Feeling rich with words,

Can you give me a reason why to stay behind
Can you say to my face that I’m not wasting all my time
Can you do one thing for me
Just let me go

Can you see the way I’m happy and the story that is ending
And my final place to be, with some quiet endlessly
Can you show me one more time
Just where to go

Forgive me, for leaving you alone
Forgive me, for not staying any more
Forgive me, for leaving you alone
Forgive me, for not waiting any more
Forgive me, for leaving you alone

Why can’t I see what’s in front of me?

I see the doors that I can’t open
Adding locks from time to time
When it opens something blocks me
And I’m asking myself why?
Did I take the step I wanted
Was it just a state of mind?
I feel sorry for myself
Every time I close my eyes

And I fall into a hole
And I can take no more…
And I fall into a hole
And I can take no more…

What’s behind the door I wonder?
Must be brighter than my past
Will I feel a little different
When I take myself across?
Was it really worth the journey?
Was it just a foolish task?
I feel sorry for myself
When I open up my eyes…

And I fall into a hole

And ring to let you know
Are you seeing someone?
I’d better let you go

She said this was a lesson in love
She said this was a love to end all loves
This soul never listens to me
This soul has a lot to learn

Honesty eludes one and all
Like some gypsy’s search for gold
He’s dreaming all the time
But the gold is hard to find

Promises are carved out of lust
With a fire in the heart
That burns with no regret
I’m getting what I get

Made a mistake with myself
My lover couldn’t lie

And in the river reflections of me

Just for a second, a glimpse of my father I see
And in a movement, he beckons to me
And in a moment, the memories are all that remain
And all the wounds are reopening again

We’re blood brothers
We’re blood brothers
We’re blood brothers
We’re blood brothers

And as you look all around at the world in dismay
What do you see, do you think we have learned
Not if you’re taking a look at the war-torn affray
Out in the streets where the babies are burned

We’re blood brothers
We’re blood brothers
We’re blood brothers
We’re blood brothers

There are times when I feel I’m afraid for the world
There are times I’m ashamed of us all
When you’re floating on all the emotion you feel
And reflecting the good and the bad

Will we ever know what the answer to life really is?
Can you really tell me what life is?
Maybe all the things that you know that are precious to you
Could be swept away by fate’s own hand

We’re blood brothers
We’re blood brothers
We’re blood brothers
We’re blood brothers

When you think that we’ve used all our chances
And the chance to make everything right
Keep on making the same old mistakes
Makes untipping the balance so easy
When we’re living our lives on the edge
Say a prayer on the book of the dead

Don’t know why I feel this way have I dreamt this time this place?
Something vivid comes again into my mind
And I think I’ve seen your face seen this room been in this place
Something vivid comes again into my mind

All my hopes and expectations looking for an explanation
Have I found my destination? I just can’t take no more

The dream is true the dream is true
The dream is true the dream is true

Think I’ve heard your voice before think I’ve said these words before
Something makes me feel I just might lose my mind
Am I still inside my dream? Is this a new reality
Something makes me feel that I have lost my mind

All my hopes and expectations looking for an explanation
Coming to the realization that I can’t take no more

I only dream in black and white I only dream ’cause I’m alive
I only dream in black and white to save me from myself
I only dream in black and white I only dream ’cause I’m alive
I only dream in black and white please save me from myself

The dream is true the dream is true
The dream is true the dream is true

I get up put on the light dreading the on coming night
Scared to fall asleep and dream the dream again
Nothing that I contemplate nothing that I can compare
To letting loose the demons deep inside my head

Dread to think what might be stirring that my dream is reoccurring
Got to keep away myself from drifting saving me from myself

I only dream in black and white I only dream ’cause I’m alive
I only dream in black and white to save me from myself
I only dream in black and white I only dream ’cause I’m alive
I only dream in black and white please save me from myself

Lost in a dream of mirrors lost in a paradox
Lost and time is spinning lost a nightmare I retrace

Lost a hell that I revisit lost another time and place
Lost a parallel existence lost a nightmare I retrace

I only dream in black and white I only dream ’cause I’m alive
I only dream in black and white to save me from myself
I only dream in black and white I only dream ’cause I’m alive
I only dream in black and white please save me from myself

Mysteries of time clouds that hide the sun
But I know, I know

I see the ghosts of navigators but they’re lost
As they sail into the sunset they’ll count the cost
As their skeletons accusing emerge from the sea
The sirens of the rocks, they beckon me

Take my heart and set it free
Carried forward by the waves
Nowhere left to run, Navigator’s son
Chasing rainbows all my days

Where I go I do not know
I only know the place I’ve been
Dreams they come and go, ever shall be so
Nothing’s real until you feel

I steer between the crashing rocks, the sirens call my name
Lash my hands onto the helm, blood surging with the strain
I will not fail now as sunrise comes the darkness left behind
For eternity I follow on there is no other way

It took so long and I’m getting so tired
I’m running out of places to hide
Should I return to the scene of the crime
Where the two young victims died
If I could go to somebody for help
It’d get me out of trouble for sure
But I know that it’s on my mind
That my doctor said I’ve done it before.

Murders in the Rue Morgue
They’re never gonna find me
Murders in the Rue Morgue
I’m never going home.

I feel unsettled, now I know that I’ve done wrong.
I’ve messed around with mystic things and magic for too long.

Places I have never seen,
Fantasies lived times before.
I split my brain, melt through the floor.

Over clouds my mind will fly,
Forever now I can’t think why.
My body tries to leave my soul.
Or is it me, I just don’t know.

Memories rising from the past,
The future’s shadow overcast.
Something’s clutching at my head,
Through the darkness I’ll be led.

Oh another time, another place.
Oh another smile on another face.
When you see me floating up beside you,
You get the feeling that all my love’s inside of you.

Please take me away, take me away, so far away.

Caution when it comes to love

And You were strong and I was not
My illusion, my mistake
I was careless I forgot

You have gone and so effortlessly
You have won
You can go ahead tell them

Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the roof tops
Write it on the sky line
All we had is gone now
Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken
All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible

Falling for betrayal is worst
Broken trust and broken hearts
I know, I know
Thinking all you need is there
Building faith on love and words
Empty promises will wear
I know, I know
And now when all is gone
There is nothing to say
And if you’re done with embarrassing me
On your own you can go ahead tell them

Tell them all I know now

Niggas thinking that they fucking with JID, y’all got the game fucked up
Tremendously, can’t fuck with the mind of a mental fiend
Who dig deep in the depths when he in too deep
I crept on the steps where the demon sleeps
And yell, belch, tell my Lord what he means to me

Hidden beneath the spot of an illuminated lamp post.
The electricity between them buzzes with each second/ Sparking into another miniature minute.

while the whiskey leers with jealousy from the bedroom work desk.
Two people who for some reason, and against the odds have managed to withstand everything that has been thrown, kicked, spit, and shouted at them.
However they still remain in true faith in the other.
The two of them inspired by each other
The same as when they first exchanged data across miles of distance and circumstance.
They are but one random equation that has blossomed into a better solution.
Within these walls is The Red King.
The union of left and right/ Moon and sun/ Silver and gold.
Within this is the sea beneath the mystery.

Let tomorrow say otherwise.

They advance into one another’s personal gate, disregarding all forms of engagement.
Her hand gripped the back of his hair.
And her gentle biting as he wrapped his arms around her. She missed touching him.
She wanted to wrap herself within his body and remain a prisoner inside his heart.
He lays to rest his active mind and dreams inside her subconscious to allow her to whisper dreams to him.
He wanted to take her into the movie of himself. And allow her to watch the tale of his life from every plot twist,
fall, and ache, and tearjerk rendered in amazing Hi-Def IMAX.

There will be a golden ladder reaching down
When the man comes around

At the terror in each sip and in each sup
Will you partake of that last offered cup?
Or disappear into the potter’s ground?

One hundred million angels singing
Multitudes are marching to the big kettledrum
Voices calling and voices crying
Some are born and some are dying

And the whirlwind is in the thorn tree
The virgins are all trimming their wicks
The whirlwind is in the thorn tree
It’s hard for thee to kick against the pricks

’Til Armageddon, no shalam, no shalom
Then the father hen will call his chickens home
The wise man will bow down before the throne
And at his feet, they’ll cast the golden crowns
When the man comes around

Whoever is unjust, let him be unjust still
Whoever is righteous, let him be righteous still
Whoever is filthy, let him be filthy still

When the man comes around

Hear the trumpets, hear the pipers
One hundred million angels singing

It’s hard for thee to kick against the pricks

And I looked and behold, a pale horse
And his name that sat on him was Death
And Hell followed with him

How are you gonna do it?

Some people like to kiss, some people like to hug
Some lesbians like eating each other’s shit out of a cup
Some people say “I love you”, some even shout it out
Some people puke semi-digested shit into each other’s mouth

Sometimes making love is not enough
You have to step it up
And urinating on her face
Is not enough to say “I love you”

Some people like to kiss, some people like to hug
Some lesbians like eating each other’s shit out of a cup
Some people say “I love you”, some even shout it out
Some people puke semi-digested shit into each other’s mouth

She’s covered in vomit and human fecies
That’s how I know that she needs me

She’s covered in vomit and human fecies
That’s how I know that she needs me

She’s covered in vomit and human fecies
That’s how I know that she needs me

Shit in my mouth
And I puke it all over your face

I love you

1163,High as Fuck,Jon Lajoie,"Have you ever watched the sun go down?
And you’re thinking ’bout the world spinning round?
Have you ever been high as fuck?

You’re in the bathroom mirror, talking to yourself
And your dog’s looking at you like you need help
Have you ever been high as fuck?

Then you feel your heart pumping really fast
And you’re convinced that you’re gonna have a heart attack
Have you ever been high as fuck?

You close your eyes and you’re on a chicken farm
The only problem’s that the chickens have human arms
You say, “that’s fucked up, why do the chickens have human arms?”

You need snacks so you walk to the corner store
But you’re scared because you think that they will know you’re high
So you walk around the block to buy some time

You finally decide to go into the store
But you’re so high you don’t know why you’re there anymore
So you just buy a pack of gum and get the hell outta there

You’re walking home and your mouth is dry
You should have bought some juice and snacks
But you were too high
Thinking ’about ketchup chips
And for some reason, the game battleship

And you start thinking about how fun it was to play games like battleship when you were a kid.
And how, as we get older, we forget how to play and just to enjoy ourselves.
So you say, “Guess what? I’m gonna make up a game right now, and it involves a baseball bat
and a porcupine, and I’m gonna try to kill a porcupine with a baseball bat”
But then you don’t know where to find a porcupine, so you go out on eBay and you do a search,
but people don’t sell porcupines on the Internet, and you say, “You know what, world? You’ve got me cornered again… I’m gonna roll another joint”

You ever eat a whole bag of crackers
That were so old that they weren’t crispy anymore?

Have you ever been high… as fuck?

1165,Sunday Afternoon,Jon Lajoie,"Ladies and gentlemen, get off the dance floor and start doing your chores, it’s Sunday afternoon!

It’s Sunday afternoon and there a few things that I have to do.
And I’m gonna do ’em, I’m gonna do ’em
It’s Sunday afternoon and there a few things that I have to do.
And I’m gonna do ’em, I’m gonna do ’em

First up, I gotta tidy up,
my place is getting messy
haven’t cleaned it in a month
I may be having friends over tomorrow night,
It’s not confirmed but just in case
I’d like my place to look nice.

Then I’ll go out to the grocery store
to get some more dish soap
I ran out a week ago
and I’ve been mixing it with water
just to make it last a little longer,
but now there’s really nothing left.

Then I’ll stop by at my parents’ to say hi
and maybe have a cup of coffee and a piece of pie.
And I’ll ask them how their week was…
“How was your week?”
And they’ll tell me how their week was…
“Pretty good.”

It’s Sunday afternoon and there a few things that I have to do.
And I’m gonna do ’em, I’m gonna do ’em
It’s Sunday afternoon and there a few things that I have to do.
And I’m gonna do ’em, I’m gonna do ’em

Then I’ll head down to the mall
pick up some black socks.
I don’t really need them
but I heard that they were half off.
You can never have too many socks you know,
so that you can always throw away the ones with holes.

Next up, take my dog out for a walk,
he needs the exercise and at the same time I talk
to the other people walking their dogs…
“Hello”
I usually ask them questions about their dogs,
“How old is he?”

Then I have to return this DVD of pornography
that my friend rented
I swear to God that it wasn’t me…
“It’s not mine, I swear.”

Alright fine, but it was the first time
I am not the kind of guy
that watches porn all the time…
Alright fine, I watch porn all the time.

It was Sunday afternoon and there were a few things that I had to do.
And I did ’em, and I did ’em
It was Sunday afternoon and there were a few things that I had to do.
And I did ’em, yes I did ’em

I only have one thing left to do,
and I’m not gonna do it in front of you.
So I’m gonna end the song like this,
as I warm up my wrist…

“Dammit, I forgot to buy kleenex.”

“Fuck…”

“Coming!”

“You want some of this, bitch?”

1206,Detachable Penis,King Missile,"I woke up this morning
With a bad hangover
And my penis was missing again
This happens all the time, it’s detachable

(Detachable penis)

This comes in handy a lot of the time
I can leave it home
get me in trouble
Or I can rent it out when I don’t need it

But now and then I go to a party,
Get drunk, and the next morning
I can’t, for the life of me,
Remember what I did with it

First I looked around my apartment
And I couldn’t find it
So I called up where the party was
They hadn’t seen it either
I asked them to check the medicine cabinet
’Cause, for some reason I leave it there sometimes
But, not this time
So I told them if it pops up to let me know

I called a few people who were at the party
But they were of no help either
I was starting to get desperate
I really don’t like being without my penis for too long
Make me feel like less of a man
And, I really hate having to sit down every time I take a leak

After a few hours searching the house,
Calling everyone I could think of,
I was starting to get very depressed, so
I went to the kia and ate breakfast

Then as I walked down the 2nd Avenue
Towards St. Marks place
Where all those people sell XXX
And other junk on the street

I saw my penis lying on a blanket
Next to a broken toaster oven
Some guy was selling it
I had to buy it off him
He wanted 22 bucks
But I talked him down to 17
I took it home, washed it off
And put it back on
I was happy again, complete

People sometimes tell me
I should get it permanently attached,
But, I dunno…
Even if sometimes it’s a pain in the ass
I like having a detachable penis

Despite its impressive length, it’s a nimble navigator, and some can be highly venomous.

As quick as lightning, just like the tarantula it’s killing, the centipede has two curved hollow fangs which inject paralyzing venom.

Even tarantulas aren’t immune from an ambush.

This centipede is a predator.

Four is for the torture and five is for the shame

You wanted to play, the coldness follows
This isn’t a game, your life, I’ll swallow
And I can’t help but smile at your pain
You wanted to play, but I already won

Gloating, I plant the seed inside your head right away, watch it grow
Destroying your insides, pleading to comfort you with my sadistic ways
I watch the tears fall, I crack a smile

Vodka, wipes away your tears
Vodka, removes your fears
Vodka, everyone is gorgeous
Vodka, yeah vodka

Drinking is good for you,
soon you are unconstrained
Drinking is good for you,
Here comes the womanizer
Drinking is good for you
Not anymore lonesome
Drinking is good for you,
and you will feel awesome

Vodka!

Under the light and shades
Eons old and new

So tell it on the streets, tell it on the radio
We’re endless like the sea, a never-ending flow
In the deepest blue

Endless summer days
That I spent with you
Into the salty haze
Of our wildest youth
Watchin’ the sun go down in the deepest blue

1234,35,La Dispute,"Drivers out on the bridge
Slowing down as they go through a lane shift
Wires snap
Concrete gives
Metal twisting
And everything tumbling

At the end of the work day
Stuck in traffic, don’t feel when the road sways
Underneath
Concrete gives
Metal twisting
And everything tumbling

To their partners and kids
Don’t suspect anything ’til the bridge splits
Wires snap
Concrete gives
Metal twisting
And everything tumbling down

Where I sat, I saw brake lights flash
And I pictured them, all the people
Their faces in free fall, the water beneath
I pushed my palms against the table hard to see if it hurt

Were it glass, would I have shattered it?
Could I battle every impulse to panic and then win
Swim out through the metal twisting
Upward like a sculpture or some terrible beast?

People trapped in their cars
Put both feet on the glass and then kick hard
Water pours in
Seatbelts twist
River flowing
And everything going down

People under the water line
Workers sift through the wreckage of it, find
Seatbelts stuck
Water fills up
River flowing
And everything going downstream

On the dining room wall, I watched it
Play in the reflection of the television
The reversal in the mirror hung, I could see it all
How the dust clouds gather color as they billow out
Shades change shifting in the night
From the lights atop an ambulance
Like a firework’s flash, then that otherworldly glow
In the smoke thrown in the aftermath blows
Almost frozen for a moment there
I could see it all

Every dust cloud
Shattered glass
Billow out on the TV
Wires snap
And the concrete gives
Metal twists up and onward

I can see it all
Every dust cloud
Shattered glass
Billow out on the TV
Wires snap
And the concrete gives in
Metal twists up and onward, I watch
And I can see it all

All the wreckage
All the cars piled
In the river and the rail yard
The metal twists
Wires snap
Concrete blocks split
And dangle from tie rods
And metal twists up

Wires sway
When a breeze blows
In the distant
Sirens glow
I can see it all

Where they look for survivors
Searchlights float
Change the color of smoke clouds
And shadows still fall
People under the water

People trapped in their cars
Kick and try to get out
People still with their seat belts on
Pets they had in the back
And car seats

And I watch it on TV lying down here
On the floor in the dining room, reversed in the mirror
Where I know I’m not dreaming now
But I know I’ve been sleeping
I just don’t know since when
I only know that it’s light outside
I only know that the rent is still late
When did they find out the concrete gave?
When did they learn that the wires snapped?

1235,Extraordinary Dinner Party,La Dispute,"Morning after snowstorm, stand in the silence
Almost feel reborn, all alone on the street
It’s a certain sort of stillness
When the quiet surrounds you
The only sound, your shovel on concrete

I remember those piles from the snow plows
Always seemed much bigger back when I was kid
Pushed all of the snow to the end of the driveway
I was the only person up in the neighborhood
Morning after snowstorm

I turned the ignition
And I started my car
Morning after snowstorm
I scraped off my windshield
With the edge of a credit card

I remember that drive into work
Still can hear the voice coming over the radio
Listen to our experts
Give the best tips
For the next time you entertain dinner guests

I thought of the day
In a tie in the kitchen, I sat
And I watched you put make-up on
Thought of the day
In the basement when I played house

I felt ashamed
That I’d stayed in my head
In the same place for so long
Because I was afraid to change
But that’s not an excuse to stay

Morning after snowstorm
I climbed up on the snowbank
And I stared at the neighborhood
Morning after snowstorm
I think I finally understood
What they meant when they said
There’s a calm after the storm

Saw my grandpa at his workbench
Building grandma’s bookshelf
Watched a woman walk her trash out to the street

Father alone on the highway
I heard the salt trucks
And neighbors off to work
Saw my mother
Saw how history loops
Around all of these moments
And then I saw you

In a dress there
With your eyes open wide
To put make-up on
Thought of the day
In the basement that I played house

And I felt ashamed
I’d ignored all the hands
That extended before and around me
Because I was afraid to change
But that’s not an excuse to stay

It’s not an excuse

1236,First Reactions After Falling Through the Ice,La Dispute,"I knew it was far too late
To walk out on the lake then
Halfway to the middle thawed
I wasn’t doing all that great
Had I cut my hair short?
Had I grown my beard out long?
Had I gone to school or…;?
Why do all my plans fall through?

There’s a leak in the basement
Stupid permanent estrangement
Casement windows need glazing
Hinges and arms need be replaced

All the way at the edge
I said, I think that we should head back
What if now the ice cracked?
Think I felt it bend
We took opposite steps
Tried to even the stress
Picked a safe direction but
You never know the way the ice thins

Half-asleep in dreams where
Ceilings start collapsing
Free fall through the roof beams
Get startled back awake
Before you hit the pavement
Floor of the foundation
Water in the basement
Bodies in the lake

Don’t panic, I could hear you
Saying as I fell through
Blackness complete down
Waiting ’til my feet touched ground
At the bottom, they finally did
First reaction was this is it
Next thought was just stay calm
Kick up and save your phone

Because I wanted to tell you
Because I thought you should know

Because I thought it might scare you
To see me under the ice
Make you remember you cared for me
What would you do if I died?
Would you fly out for my funeral?
Get too drunk at my wake?
Would you make a scene then
Climb in and try to resuscitate me?

I was on the ice and I was underwater

I was getting pulled out
I was in my wet clothes
Stumble on the walk back
Someone stoked the fire at camp
I was by the flames
Trying to get my body warm
I was standing naked
Checking to see if my phone still worked

I will cut my hair short
Trust me, I will
I will let my beard go
Trust me, I will
I will never tempt fate
Not once, I swear
I will never trust ice
I will never trust a thing

1237,For Mayor in Splitsville,La Dispute,"Funny what you think of after a collapse
While lying in the dirt
The first thing that comes back
Is never quite what you’d have guessed
And if you could have
You probably would’ve said you’d check
If all your limbs were intact
Still and then try to get out

We played house with the
Neighbors in their basement
Sister made me husband
She was older so I did her bidding
I remember once their dad came in
And said, ""You think this is bad?
You don’t know the half""
And he laughed

It’s funny what things come back
The first things you see

How he sort of smiled
Like it’s only a joke, but he was lying
There was something else inside of his eyes
All those secrets people tell to little children
Are warnings that they give them
Like, ""Look, I’m unhappy
Please don’t make the same mistake as me""

Why are those old worn out jokes
On married life told at toasts
At receptions still?

How does it never occur
How often couples get burned
And end uncertain in Splitsville?

Funny what you think of in the wreckage
Lying there in the dirt and the dust and the glass
How you’re suddenly somewhere
In the desert, in the night time
And it’s gettin’ close to Christmas
And then her and that movie voice she uses when she reads
""Welcome to the Land of Enchantment"" from a highway sign
And it’s late so you take the next exit

When that trip ended, we came back
The rent was due, I was jobless
I guess in retrospect, I should’ve sensed decay
Then that day, how you said
""I just don’t know"" and I promised
We’d rearrange things
Ro fix the mess I’d made here

But I guess in the end
We just moved furniture around
But I guess in the end
We just moved furniture around
But I guess in the end
We just moved furniture around
But I guess in the end

It sort of feels like every day it’s harder
To stay happy where you are
There are all these ways to look through the fence
Into your neighbor’s yard

Why even risk it?
It’s safer to stay distant
When it’s so hard now to just be content
Because there’s always something else

Now I’m proposing my own toast
Composing my own joke for those married men
Maybe I’m miserable
I’d rather run for mayor in Splitsville
Than suffer your jokes again

1238,Objects in Space,La Dispute,"Yesterday alone I laid everything out on the carpet
Books, kitchen things, objects with specific purpose or none
Arranged them sideways in a grid on the floor there unmoored
Out of context and then considered it

First the whole picture, then everything individually
Humming along at the deadest pace imaginable
One object, then another, and then the next
And I wondered what they meant there
If they meant anything still

Found notes
Camping supplies
A book you bought in the desert
""Identifying Wildflowers""
Pictures from vacations
From parties
Kitschy gifts we bought from rest stops
On that road trip out west
Objects
Everything itself
And then memory

All of it laid out there
From the dining room
The living room
The hallway and the basement and the kitchen
From that room we called the office but never used
Even the bathroom
Everything laid out there
On the floor, on the carpet, out of context

And I sat there for hours

Today I moved everything from the floor
To the table in the dining room
Placed each thing carefully without reason
Or at least without one I understood or could describe
There on the table together
And when I was done and stepped back
I realized what I had made
Keepsakes, pictures, letters
Ordinary objects all collected there
A memorial

And I thought of ones on highways or set by gravestones
All the things you see there but don’t understand
But still bring a remembered thing back vividly
Invoke someone’s reality when they’re together
In that place, in that way, out of context
And I knew I had to take it down before anybody else saw

Tomorrow I plan to put them all somewhere
Those things in boxes
Side of the road, attic maybe
All these things that push and pull me through history
To places I once was
Places I might’ve gone
Places I ended up going

Postcards
Ticket stubs from one thing or another
A personalized coffee mug
With neither your name nor mine
Phone cards and old phones
A page from an old calendar I bought once
At a thrift store and insisted on hanging
That cycles of the moon print
Photos, old boots of mine
Put them in boxes

And I sat there for hours
In the living room first
Then in the dining room
Moving things around
Picking things up and seeing where they took me

To what place in history
What moment on our timeline
Where we were, where I was
Where I thought we’d end up
In this house or on the highway
Driving somewhere near Christmas
In the desert or anywhere else

And I put them in boxes

1239,SCENES FROM HIGHWAYS 1981-2009,La Dispute,"I let the car drift some
Eye your uncomfortable pose in profile
The postures of long drives
That endless cycling of your numb and near sleeping parts

And you lean much harder than you need
When the road curves
Swerve through traffic
And the cracks in the ground
Every gesture you require
Of a drive like this night
When you fight now
You just head out of town

I let the wheel go
Over center lines
Inside a place without time
A loop through history
Eye you in periphery
Now prone in the passenger seat
It’s a mystery
The ways you can sleep

I want to leave here
For where nobody goes
I want to breathe in the air of all
Those sprawling ancient spaces on earth
You said we’re so scared of alone
And I knew what you meant
You want to go where it glows
All those places where your watch doesn’t work

You were riding those nights
On the highway, always hiding out
Inside a songwriter’s dream there
Like a scene from a song
""Born to Run"" or maybe ""Running on Empty""

Ones where they would leave
Certain nights when you’d fight
You couldn’t stick around
So you’d head out of town
Just hit the highway and drive
Certain nights when you’d thought it was fine
But it shook you when the baby would cry

Why did you always turn around in the end?
To hear the shattering of glass on the door again?
So loud the baby couldn’t sleep any more?
What didn’t you find that you were looking for?

Your mother called a hardware
Set you up an interview
An answer to an ad
The bosses’ daughter still remembers dinner where her father
Said he wouldn’t stick his neck out for trouble again

But they did then
And those days you’d wake up
And just decide you wouldn’t show
He’d show up at your door
Nights you’d skip town
He’d follow you out
Pretty soon you started falling for their daughter
And she fell for you

Drive, roll every window down
Let the desert enter, heavy and primitive in
Drift ’til rumble strips sound
Time moves so slow but I know
That you meant what you said
You want to go where it’s frozen
All those places where the highways don’t reach

You want to go where it glows
Somewhere that time is irrelevant
You want to go where it glows
Somewhere the spaces are infinite

You want to go where it glows
Somewhere you don’t feel the hours pass by
You identified the flowers on the road
I rolled the windows down and shut off the radio

Did you ever think you’d end up here?
All those late nights you were driving alone?
You were riding to hide
Or you were looking for a brand new life
Did you ever think you’d find one back home?

Did you even think you’d get out alive?
Could you imagine then, the love you now know?

I think history’s a system of roads
And there’s nowhere it doesn’t go

I pulled over to the side and felt no time
Off the highway with the landscape aglow
Still not sure what we were trying to find
I only know we went home

1240,Stay Happy There,La Dispute,"If I could play back every moment to you now
Spent lovesick and swollen on
Mornings mincing garlic
On the counter by the sink
If I could hit the instant replay
On only every good day
Would any of it catch you by surprise?

When you say, something is missing now
That’s what came back to me
Normal mornings like that
Set the knife down and forget
Where I’d left it
Making breakfast
Put coffee on the stove
Then scour every counter for the knife

Don’t be shy
Don’t be kind
Somewhere snow collects
And bends the boughs of pines

But doesn’t it seem a bit wasteful to you
To throw away all of the time
We spent perfecting our love
In close quarters and confines?
Isn’t it wasteful? And I
Am terrified that it doesn’t feel painful to me yet
Somewhere on top of the high rise
There’s a woman on the edge of a building at the ledge
And traffic’s backing up on 35

It’s alright
I will fix whatever is not
The sweetness in your eyes
Just sit down, please, sit down
Here at the table and we’ll talk
Somewhere televisions light up in the night

I know things weren’t right
Maybe we were never cut out for the Midwest life
Maybe we’d have done much better on a coast
There are certain things I doubt we’ll ever know

I know you were getting tired of my drinking
I guess I was never cut out for the coke scene
You were worried I would end up like your father
And tired of the smoke and somewhere the wind blows

Somewhere a storm touches down north in Hudsonville
Somewhere the coffee starts to boil on the stove
And somewhere the wind blows
Somewhere the river levels finally getting low
Somewhere I’m up past dawn ’til
Somewhere you live here still
Somewhere you’re already gone

Somewhere a radio is playing in a living room
Says the city lacks the funds to fix the bridge

Somewhere the deer are overrun
So they’re introducing wolves back on the ridge

And from here in the kitchen
I can hear the neighbors in the alley hanging linens
And the men collect the trash bins in the street
You’re speaking to me but I can’t understand you
The coffee is burning

And all of the times that we spent
That road trip out west
Through desert for the rest stops
The kitsch we both collect
That winter the whole weekend
We huddled by the stove
The cabin I had rented
The unexpected snow
That visit for Christmas
On television binges
We’ll see friends in Brooklyn
Drive south to Richmond
There’s traffic on the bridge
A woman on the ledge
And everywhere the wind

Everything is happening at once

1241,THE CHILD WE LOST 1963,La Dispute,"There were shadows in the bedroom
Where the light got thrown by the lamp on the night stand
On your mother's side, after midnight, still
You can see it all, you can see it all

And the closet in the corner
On the far back shelf with the keepsakes, she hid
That box there, full of letters of regret
By the pictures of the kids

You get faint recollections of your
Mother's sigh, countryside drive
And the landscape seen from the window of the back seat
With some flowers in a basket

That afternoon after school
You and your older sisters
Found your parents in the kitchen at the table
Father lifting off the lid of the box

And a hush fell
Over everything like a funeral prayer
A reverence, ancestral, heavy in the air
Though you didn't understand what it meant

That they never said her name aloud around you
Even sitting at the table with her things they'd kept
You recall faintly cards, tiny clothes
And the smell of the paint in the upstairs bedroom
Until then you didn't know that's what the box had held

Your parents tiptoeing slowly around
Always speaking in code

No, they never said her name aloud around you
Only told you it was perfect where your sister went
And you didn't understand why it hurt them
So much then that she'd come and left so soon
Could only guess inside your head at what a ""stillbirth"" meant
Only knew that mother wept

You watched while father held her
Said ""Some things come, but can't stay here""
You saw a brightness, like a light through your eyes
Closed tight then she tumbled away

From here, some place
To remain in the night time shadows she made
To be an absence in mom
A sadness hanging over her

Like some pentecostal flame
Drifting on and off
She was ""Sister"" only whispered
Sometimes ""Her"" or ""The Child We Lost""

You were visions
A vagueness
A faded image
You were visions

You were a flame lit
That burned out twice as brightly
As the rest of us did
When you left, you were light
Then you tumbled away

There are shadows that fall
Still here at a certain angle
In the bedroom on the night stand
By your mother's side
From the light left on there

There's the box in the closet
All the things kept
And the landscape where she left
Flowers on the grave
Marble where they etched that name
And mother cried the whole way home

But she never said it once out loud
On the way back home from where you thought they meant
When they said where sister went

After grandpa got hospice sick
And he couldn't fall sleep
They wheeled his stretcher bed beside her at night
And I saw the light

On the day that he died
By their bed in grandma's eyes
While us grandkids said our goodbyes

She said, ""Don't cry""
Somewhere he holds her
And said a name I didn't recognize
And the light with all the shadows combined…;

1242,Woman (reading),La Dispute,"You in the living room
You on a Tuesday afternoon
A breeze seen when the curtains move

You by the window with both feet up on the couch
Where you sit and you read and I watch you

From the office, the sunlight frames your silhouette
I think of lighting fireworks, I think of pirouettes
I idly write down observations on the scene
Like do the blueprints name the rooms alone?
Do we name them on our own?
We hardly live in there

You with a book propped on your knees
A breeze seen in your coffee steam

I’m in the office thinking back to rules of poetry, like
It’s fourteen lines, the last two rhyme, what does pentameter mean?

You in the living room
Legs bent at forty-five degrees
I write AB AB
Try to find your rhyme scheme

I look for objects on the desk
With which to sculpt your image best
What would I name this, could I paint it?
Woman (reading)? Girl (at rest)?

I remember it so well
Watching you shifting your weight
Turning the page
I can see it all there
Inside a living room
Where only I live
And never go in
A role in name alone

And I pause where I am for a second when I hear your name
Sometimes I think I see your face in improbable places
Do those moments replay for you?
When I’m suddenly there and then won’t go away
When you’re sitting in the living room reading for the afternoon
Do you put your book down, look and try to find me there?

Sometimes I think of all the people
Who lived here before us
How the spaces in the memories you make
Change the room from just blueprints
To the place where you live

When you leave here
When you go from a home
You take all that you own
But the memories echo

On hardwood floor in the living room
Tore the carpet, the scratches below that we found
And the wine stain on the couch
We got drunk and decided
We’d still try to move it around

And I can’t tell what the difference is
Between the ones that we made
And the ones that we didn’t make
They all conjure images still
Where you sit and you read
In the sunlight, aware that I watch

And I live alone now
Save for the echoes

I live alone now
Save for the echoes

1243,Andria,La Dispute,"You still cross my mind from time to time
And I mostly smile
Still so set on finding out where we went wrong and
Why

So I retrace our every step with an unsure pen
Trying to figure out what my head thinks, but
My head just ain’t what it used to be
And then again, what’s the point anyway?

I remember you ascending all the stairs up to the balcony
To see if you could see me, hidden quietly away
I remember the skin of your fingers
The spot three quarters up I’d always touch when I was out of things to say

You held my hand, but you were too afraid to speak
You were too afraid to speak and I could never understand
I remember when you leaned in quick to kiss me, and I swear
Not a single force on earth could stop the trembling of my hand

And I remember how you smiled through the smoke
In a crowded little coffee house and laughed at all my jokes
And I remember the way that you dressed
How we wasted all the best of us in alcohol and sweat

And I remember when I knew that you’d be leaving
How I barely kept up breathing
And I bet, if I had to do it all again
I’d feel the same pain

And I remember panicked circles
In the terminal in tears
How I wept to god in fits
I’ve hated airports ever since

It must be true what people say
That only time can heal the pain
And every single day I feel it fade away, but

I still remember how the distance tricked us
And lead us helpless by the wrist into a pit to be devoured
I still remember how we held so strong to this
Though we had never really settled on a way out

I still remember the silence
And how we’d always find a way to turn and run to our mistakes
I still remember how it all came back together
Just to fall apart again

My dear, I hear your voice in mine

I’ve been alone here
I’ve been alone here
I’ve been afraid, my dear
I’ve been afraid, my dear

I’ve been at home here
I’ve been at home here
You’ve been away for years
You’ve been away for years

I’ve been alone
I’ve been alone
I’ve been alone
I’ve been alone

I breathed your name into the air
I etched your name into me
I felt my anger swelling
I swam into its sea

I held your name inside my heart
But it got buried in my fear
It tore the wiring of my brain
I did my best to keep it clear

So, dear, no matter how we part
I hold you sweetly in my head
And if I do not miss a part of you
A part of me is dead

If I can’t love you as a lover
I will love you as a friend
And I will lay a bed before you
Keep you safe until the end

1244,Bury Your Flame,La Dispute,"Oh, we could blame it on our hands
They lifted the drink to our mouths so we drank it
Or we could blame it on our bodies
They say, ""We like the way we feel when we get touched""

You’ve got your fingers snared in my veins
I think it’s time you pulled them out
And I don’t care about the flesh it’ll tear
It isn’t flesh that I’m worried about

We held a match to keep our sight on the path
But the flame gave up and we lost it
And I’ve knelt for the last three years
Trying to find it back with the blackened matchstick

Today I’m not afraid of failure
""The past is a flower; the future, the snow""
I wasn’t ever close to perfect
But I never let you go

You let your doubt like a river
Lead you on and on and on and
You will never get back
To save what you had, hear me promise, ""I will
Bury your problems in me so sleep soundly""
I held your heart in my fingers
Now it’s gone, it’s gone, it’s gone and
You will never admit
That you bid the wind blow the flames out
And buried the coals in the sea, you tricked me

You came back and you brought floods
Wearing a necklace made of hearts
That you’d dragged through the mud
And I guess I wasn’t quite sure what to say to you

But then I saw mine, almost reached out to grab it. Said,
""Darling, you’re the only one on Earth I want to have it""
But now I’m not so sure that that was true
After the hell you put it through

But there was no sharp pain this time
Just the ghost of your presence compressing my chest like a vine
An unshakeable absence, like most of my insides
Crawled out through my mouth and went west. But that’s fine

We cast our hearts in plaster
We imagined our bodies were fashioned from stone but
They chipped at the brick and the mortar
We found out that we’re only layers of skin hiding bone

And our bones are like chains
Old and rusted in the rain
They’re going to snap when the weight shifts

You moved like a fire through the forest
Your hands were as red as the skin on your lips
You’d been flirting with distance, princess
I tasted its spit in your kiss

Oh, mistress, know
Today I will bury the flames of your failure
The past is a liar; the future, a whore
I’ll lay your bones into the earth and you
Will haunt my head no more

Oh, we could blame it on our hands
Oh, we could blame it on our hands, but
It was our mouths that opened up to swallow
And our heads that commanded us drink

But as I buried your flames in the dirt
I watched the smoke pull your ghost from the grave. And
I fear they’ll only lay in wait
Till we are face to face again

Just when I said, ""I’m moving, I’m moving on""
I felt them come to life again
And again, and again, and again

There are fires
That tear through valleys and make dust from grass
There are fires

There are wires
Bound to blue light they pull us to the past
There are wires

We are tired
We should’ve known from the start that this thing wouldn’t last
We are tired

1245,Damaged Goods,La Dispute,"She forced a smile, said, ""Boy, come kiss my mouth.
You know that hope you’re holding to? It looks an awful lot like fear.
Now, you’re so quick to fall on failure, and so quick to raise your voice, like,
’If I can’t find a mistake to blame, we didn’t have a choice.’

Oh, but you had an option.
I was your chance to feel complete,
But when I leaned in close to you, you
Kissed your fear instead of me.

You had my hand in your hand,
You had my lip in your teeth,
You had my heart on your sleeve,
You had a chance to breathe.

But, boy, you wouldn’t let your fear recede so I moved on.

And it’s too late to change your mind now,
You got scared, boy, and I got gone.
Now you failed, and there’s no way to turn back time.
You had your chance, boy, I tried.""

""You tried?"" I looked her in the eye and smiled,
""My girl, you must understand that fear is not some product that I made.
It crept unwelcome in my head the day they had her torn away.
It changed me.

Now at the end of every day I lie awake at night and wait
To feel the wires of my brain get cut and quietly rearranged, and
Hear my beaten heart exclaim, ’Still, I refuse to let her go.’

So we escape to our mistakes for they wait patiently for us.
Oh, how they always wait for me.

If my fear has kept me here, only my fear can set me free.
And I’m sorry, dear, but don’t you dare speak another word.
How could I risk holding your heart in me while still in love with her?
You were wrong.""

1246,"Fall Down, Never Get Back Up Again",La Dispute,"Out where the stones lay like bones by the ocean
Out where the waves crash contempt on the land
Someone was trembling for fear of the tempest
Somebody silently reached for their hand

Said, ""Understand that if you’re cold, I’ll keep you warm
And besides, there’s so much beauty in a storm
So come down with me to the shore
And what’s more? I adore you

So tell me, what is there to fear?
You think some seraph up above
Is trying to rob us of our love
Because the sky’s not clear?
My dear, you know there’s not
Now, listen to the rain upon the rooftop""

But the wind picked up

Out where the stones stand up like thrones beside the ocean
Out where the waves make a grave of the sea
The lovers struggled in the middle of the tempest
And water angrily crawled up onto the beach

Said, ""Hold my hand, and stay with me, we’ll be released""
But the tide clung like an anchor to her feet
And though he tried to make the water line recede
It pulled her out into the sea

He could not break apart the waves
To bring her safely back in
He watched her hand break through the surface once
Then disappear again

Forever wait inside the sea for me
My dear, I hear you
You speak in every curling wave
And sing in every violent breeze
Someday not far away from here
My dear, I swear I’ll see you
And we will hear the seraphs cry
They will still envy you and I

How they envied you and I
How they envied you and I
How they envied you and I

I am in shambles
I am crumbling, I am
Was it something I did
Bid the tide
To climb so high
That it ripped our shore up?

I can fix it, I swear
If you trust me
I am old and I am rusting
But I care, I care""

""My precious wife
We made a promise
Pledged our flesh to be one
How can you doubt a love
That stood so proud as we raised our children?

I believe in
It still
It has faltered, and it is faded
But I know
It’s there, it’s there.

And how’d it change?
The way you thought of me?
How strange to think we once were lovers
Now we’ve wrapped the past up in broken glass
And when you speak my name you shudder

Oh precious wife
Please believe this
I’ll revive it, I will
We’ve built a family from this marriage
Why would you tear it apart?""

""Oh, speak now, precious
Your silence screams
You’re giving in to failure

Hear me
The promise that you made
Was meant to live forever

Until our deathbed
You’re not allowed to change your mind
Was there nothing in that promise?
Are you listening to me?""

""Oh, husband, I could not control it
Husband, I could not abstain
One cannot stop the wind from blowing
Nor refuse the falling rain

Love stirred up a storm inside me
Wrapped its arms around my waist
I failed you

Oh, I’m sorry

There was nothing I could do

Some love just fails without a reason""

1248,New Storms for Older Lovers,La Dispute,"I’ve come here as a man in shambles
Worn out from begging on my knees
Please, I’m just trying to keep my family together
Now when you saw your lover
Wore a ring around her finger
Why didn’t you stop?

I have half a mind to make you hurt
To make you bleed, to make you suffer
I swear, if you’ve touched her
Oh heaven, forgive what I would do
To you, you monster
Think about your children
They’ll never believe what you’ve done

Listen, I am begging you
Back off
Let me rebuild all the things that you shattered

She meant it
I swear that she meant it
She whispered so often
""Husband, I’ll always be here with you""

Always
Always
Always
Always
Always
Always
Always is valueless
I wish I’d never heard her speak a word

And I hope you see us
Your wife and your children and I
Buried in the wreckage of your crime
While you’re laying down your sins
Softly leaning in to kiss your guilt goodnight

She is mine, she is, she is mine
You stole her, somehow tricked her but
We’ll survive, we will, we’ll survive
She loves me dearly, you’ll see, she
You are blind, you are, you are blind
She loves me, dearly loves me, she

Breathe in, breathe in
Breathe in, breathe in
Breathe in, breathe in
Breathe in, breathe in

He finally paused to take a breath
Then looked down
It felt like staring into hell
The man was seated in a chair
Before him, silent
A statue framed in pain and flesh

He thought, ""Oh, what more can I say
To sway him?
To make this statue speak?
I swear he’s made of stone and I
Am barely stirring up a breeze""
I’m barely stirring up a breeze

And after waiting
In this silence, finally
He finally turned around to leave
Broken and barely through the doorway
Breathing slowly
Beating hard, he heard him
Speak

""I guess love’s a funny thing
The way it fades away without a warning
It doesn’t ask to be excused
And when it’s gone, oh, it’s gone
And it ain’t ever comin’ back

There is nothing you can do to save it
To make it breathe the way it did
When you were sliding on the ring
Trust me, it’s gone for
Good

Now there is nothing you can do to stop me
She is happy when she is with me and I am
I am finally alive
I’m sorry""

Likely dreaming off the pain
I hope you’ll hear me in the streetlights humming
Softly breathing out your name

Scars will remain

I say we scrape them from each other, darling
And let them wash off in the rain
And when they run into the river
Oh no, let the water not complain

Your hands still catch the light the right way
And our hearts still beat the same

""Should we feel guilty for this sin?
Lord, did we kill a man and woman
Just to lie here skin to skin?""

""I wasn’t happy
I wasn’t happy where I was

What is purpose without love?

I pray my children will forgive me
Though I bade the river flood
I have washed my hands a thousand times
But still can see the blood

I still can see the blood""

""Oh, great mercy, I am here
To beg forgiveness for this mess
I know I tore two worlds apart
But I can’t change the way I felt

Love swept in like a storm
And ripped the hinges from the doors
Love poured in like a flood
I couldn’t stop it any more

I will not be
No, I will not be
Drowned""

She said, ""Lover, come and hold me
I’m terribly afraid
While you’re shouting at the stars
My scars are not fading away""

He said, ""Darling, I was begging
Heaven make them disappear
But see, I didn’t get an answer
Or at least one I could hear

Now, I am thinking of the past
And how we both said vows and lied
And I am wondering how we trust ourselves
To say a second time

To say a second time""

To have and to hold
From this day and onward
For better or for worse
For richer or poorer
In sickness and in health
To love and to cherish

1251,Said the King to the River,La Dispute,"Up, my lady, pack your things, this place is not your home. Nor was it ever, sever every tie, tonight we ride. Tonight we ride.

Tonight we ride

And how we’ve trembled at the way that time assembles little fires of desire in the tundra of our skin. So do yourself a little favor, savor every time you waver for that shaking in my voice was only slyly feigned chagrin. Tonight we ride.

Tonight we ride

Oh, lover, uncover. I know it’s warm beneath your sheets, and there is ice along the streets, but listen, lover, we will recover. But we’ve no time to waste with meddling in affairs, we’ve locked so tightly in our dreams. We are not clean, we are not pure, we will not rest until we’re sure. So rob your pretty little eyes of sleep’s disguise. I’m at your bedside with a bucket full of lies, so clear your ears and listen. Up, my lady, pack your things, this place is not your home.

And I know what is

And to the glorious past: You’ve opened my window but broken the glass. And I beseech thee, ’shed thy beauty.’ For as a child leaves the womb and learns the cold, you have taught us peril in the present, and you will bring us peril in our surely-soon-will-be. Unless…;

The river’s not flooded this time

Oh, precious distance
Oh, precious pain
You’ve given me a name
And etched it in the stones of the river bank

Oh, precious distance
Oh, precious pain
You’ve given us a name
You’ve given us a name

""Rise!"" said the King to the River, ""Never let up! No, bring us a flood and bring it hard!"" ""Freeze!"" said the Wind to the Water, ""Never give in! No, build us a bridge! And build it strong and angry. Let it stall the King’s decrees. Oh, you must contemplate the current, Boy, and command that coward cease. The boy breathes for his love says, ’I wait.’ His love says, ’I wait.’ She’s shouting out, ""I will come back. Yes, I will come back! And I will come. I have lived my life so uncomfortably. Darling, come for me, come for me.""

""Rise!"" said the Boy to his Lover, ""Darling, get up. I’ve brought you my love, and brought it far!""
""Leave!"" said the Girl to her Lover, ""I’ve given in. If love is a bridge, we built it wrong!""

Curb your anger
Still your fists

She’ll never come back
She’ll never come
Never come back

1252,Such Small Hands,La Dispute,"I think I saw you in my sleep, darling
I think I saw you in my dreams, you were
Stitching up the seams on every broken promise
That your body couldn’t keep

I think I saw you in my dreams, you were
Stitching up the seams on every broken promise
That your body couldn’t keep
I think I saw you in my sleep

I thought I heard the door open, oh no
Thought I heard the door open but I only heard it close
I thought I heard a plane crashing
But now I think it was your passion snapping

I think you saw me confronting my fear, it
Went up with the bottle and went down with the beer and
I think you ought to stay away from here
There are ghosts in the walls and they
Crawl in your head through your ear

1253,The Castle Builders,La Dispute,"Now speak of anger
Forget all the fears you’ve kept
About love and sex and death and faith
Erased, or swinging sweet
From around her neck

And between her breasts
Let every lonely body
Finally break its fear of flesh
And say, ""How strange it must’ve been
Back when we shook at the sight of sweat""

And let our worries wander out
Like water streaming from a spring
And sing of all the things
Our heads have failed to ruin
There’s so much they have failed to ruin yet

Bright as lightning
Loud as thunder
We’ll move all the hurt aside
To let love sustain our passions
And move up and onward
We are not our losses
We are only the extent to which we love

So build a home for your family
And build a castle for your friends
Now set their beds with sheets and blankets
Keep them safe until the end

I’ve felt the damage and burn from the fallout
My love failed but theirs prevailed
My friends, I’m only flesh and bone
But I won’t let you die alone

So leave our hearts at the foot of the mountain
Let our burdens be locked in the stone
If you will help me roll it upward
I won’t let you die alone

I see a beauty springing upward
From the earth and from out our hearts
For all the bad that seems to plague us
I swear to you there’s good

No, oh, I won’t let you die alone
My love, I will not let you die alone

They say that death is not a problem
It’s a promise
I can only say for sure
That when it makes your bed
I’ll kiss your head goodnight

So speak of all the love we lost
And what it cost us
Left us beg our breath to stop
But we kept on
And we were strong
And we, and we

Stayed bright as lightning
We sang loud as thunder
We moved ever forward
We are not our failures
We are love

1254,The Last Lost Continent,La Dispute,"I felt your sickness
Brush against my arm
As I walked by you
Heard your voice but
Couldn’t tell that it was you

And slowly
Watched your sickness slip away
Into a place
That I’d once feared, but I
Was not afraid this time

So I gave chase and found it, finally
Slowly feeding from your head
And from my friends, and from my family
So I grabbed it by the neck

""For every lover you have ruined…;""
I dug my nails into its flesh
""…;and every life that you have taken""
Slammed its head against the brick

Its blood poured out onto the pavement
I stirred it in with dirt and spit
""I will take a part of you""
I made mortar from the mix

Tore every organ from its body
Broke its bone and fashioned bricks
I laid the mortar in between
I made a throne for hope to sit

""Too long you’ve torn us into pieces
Firmly held onto our wrists
Today I bury you in me""
I swallowed every inch of it

I’ll
I’ll hold you
As you have held me
You’ve held me in your heart

We’ll be
We’ll be set free from
We’ll be set free from
Fear, we’ll be set free

Oh we’ve felt our failures
We’ve watched our passions
Leave, but we’re still breathing
Oh but we’re still beating on

I’ll
I’ll hold you
As you have held me
You’ve held me in your heart

(And I will hold you in my heart)

But I still see him
Dead in the parking lot
At the gas station just down the street

And I still hear my friend say
""You know, you wouldn’t believe the things
I saw when I was stationed overseas""

But he somehow keeps smiling
In spite all of that
While I keep finding ways
To push the good out for the bad

Oh how selfish of myself
To always say that it was
More than I could take
Like it was pain I couldn’t shake
Like it could break me with its fingers
Throw my body in the lake
And I would slowly sink away

But the truth is, it was sorrow
That I made
And wouldn’t face
See, I keep falling for the future
After tripping on the past
And I am always tearing sutures out
To make the anguish last

Like it defines me
Or reminds me
I’ve found comfort in my suffering
And uncertainty in happiness and death
Because what’s next is such a mystery to me
And I am terrified of all the things
I feel but cannot see

Friends and family
Put your hand into my hand
And lay your head into my chest
You are all that I have left here
We are all that we have left

We are the lovers
We are the last of our kind
So link your arms and keep your chin up
And I swear that we’ll be fine

We are the lovers
We are the last of our kind

Though we are not sure who we are
We keep our heads up
Though we are not sure where we’re from
We keep our hearts up
Though we are not sure when we’ll leave
We keep our heads up
Though we are not sure where we’ll go
We keep our hopes up

Though we’re not sure who we are
We keep our heads up
Though we’re not sure where we’re from
We keep our hearts up
Though we’re not sure when we’ll leave
We keep our heads up
Though we’re not sure where we’ll go
We keep our hopes up

Keep your head up
We’re fine
Just keep your head up
I swear we’ll be alright

Keep your head up
My friends, my friends
Keep your head up
I swear

I swear we’ll never die, I swear
We’ll get home safe and sound, I swear
I swear we’ll never die, I swear
We’ll live on underground, I swear

I will give your heart a place to rest
When everything you had has turned and left

I’ll weave your names into my ribcage
Lock your hearts inside my chest
Regain the passion I once carried
Do away with all the rest

I tore the sickness from your bodies
Smashed its head against the bricks
I made a castle from its bones
That you may always dwell in it

So sing for every buried moment
That you’d thought would never end
And sing your fears about the future
And a dirge for faded friends

For all the love that you had held to
Why it somehow failed to keep
And sing each minute you’ve been frightened
Every hour that you’ve lost sleep

And sing for all your friends and family
Sing for those who didn’t survive
But sing not for their final outcome
Sing a song of how they tried

We live amidst a violent storm
Leaves us unsatisfied at best
So fill your hearts with what’s important
And be done with all the rest

We are what’s left of what we once were
We are falling far behind
There’s so much stacking up against us
And we’re running out of time

We are but hopeful children
And we’re the last of our kind
But if we let our hearts move outward
I know we will never

We are but friends and family
We are the last of our kind
So hold my hand, I’ll lift your head up
And I promise we’ll be fine

We are but hopeful lovers
And we are running out of time
There’s so much stacking up against us
And we’re falling far behind

We are but hopeful lovers
We are the last of our kind
But if we let our hearts move outward
I know we will never

We are but lovers
We are the last of our kind
And if we let our hearts move outward
I know we will never

We are but lovers
We are the last of our kind
And if we let our hearts move outward
We will never die

""But see, boy, that’s my point

And I’ve already forgiven you

In streams, into her hands where she was stitching
On the flesh he’d left in sections
On the carpet near a bed that
Never slept while you was sleeping
In her clothes that he had laid with
On the floor with all his fingers
Crossed, in hoping that that distance wouldn’t grow

But how it grew, and how it hurt
And how it hallowed every memory he’d
Never felt was threatened by a thing the world could
Conjure up to kill them

In every curve and crack

It says it in every detail of your face
Unmistakably apparent in this dull light

Twisting together
To build the same beautiful sentence
The same painful realization

The cracks in your lips
Open with the book
And the smile shows the lines in your face
Perfectly crooked
And perfectly familiar

The cracks in your lips
Open with the book
And the smile shows the lines in your face
Perfectly crooked
And perfectly familiar

And by the moment
Uncovered like a statue
Lay perfectly still
To show the cracks in your lips
Give purpose to this pattern and start to smile

Burst into flames, disappear
Before your best intentions
Can no longer hide her ears
From that which will make them bleed

Or your own two hands become too weak
To hold the blood inside the wounds

Or reality explodes before you
In a brilliant flash of spectral fire
To a thousand fragments of a past
Long dead and gone

This is remembering the last time we touched
The last time we spoke
Words ricocheting off empty tables

Vandalizing the pictures on these smoke-stained walls
And I can feel your mouth
As it opens from across the room

Your tongue and lips, forming the shape of your laughter
It’s the curve of your stomach, it’s the bend in your legs
It’s the remnants of pages framed in the cracks of your bleeding lips

But disturbed by the sight of our scars
And now we carry scalpels
To trace the scarring
Resting somewhere on the line between my house
Your heart and into your home

Where you lay sleeping like a ceiling fan in winter
Gently turning as the wind reaches its fingers through the window
Just to hold you, like I held you
Pressed like a rose between my fingers
Or like stones I keep in pockets
Meant to weigh me underwater
Meant to keep me underwater
I meant to keep me underwater

These scars will fade away but never disappear, my dear
We’ll raise our fists like lightning rods to god and
If he strikes us down, then he strikes us down
But first, let him hear us speak
We are like the legacy of thunderstorms
We watched and swore in doorways
That we would never be the same again

I can feel you healing and I hate it
Like a harpist without hands
You only bang the strings
You used to love to touch so much
To hear the dissonance drain violently
Into the air and then dissolve
Like all the songs I sang
But never once could make you smile
My god, I would kill to make you smile
My god, I would kill to make you smile

Oh, my god, I would kill to make you smile
My god, I would kill to make you smile

To make good on the love that you swear
Still exists, and still thrives
Though we’ve buried our bodies in blood
And old lies, like, ""I’m fine""
And ""You look so much better than him""

But don’t trust the surgeon with your heart
She’s drunk and sips from poison cups
And don’t you trust the scientist
He says ""Life is like a wineglass""

All across your dress and says
""My dear, I must confess
I never thought you ever knew
What love was like for real
I never thought you needed me""

Things get cloudy and now

All these stories and the
Struggle as an undercurrent
Both get blurry by the minute
Both get blurrier

So which voice is this then
That I am writing in?
Is it my own or his?
Has there ever been a difference
Between them at all?

I don’t know
I don’t know

One last desperate plea
One last verse to sing
One last laugh track to
Accompany the comedy

Have I been losing it completely
Losing sanity? Or
Has it been fabricated
Fashioned by the worst of me?

I know I knocked the table over
Because I watched the jar break
And I’ve been trying to repair it
Every single stupid day

But won’t the cracks still show
No matter how well it’s assembled?
Can I ever just decide
To let it die
And let you go?

All my motives and
Every single narrative below
Reflects that moment when it broke
And will I never let it go
No matter what?

Now I am throwing all the shards away
Discarding every fragment
And fumbling uncertain
Towards a curtain call

That no one wants to happen
That no one’s going to clap for at all
But that still has to be

1262,a Departure,La Dispute,"…for everything

Night fell on me writing this
And I ran out of paper
So I crossed the name out
At the top of the page

Not sure why I’m even writing this
But I guess it feels right
It sort of feels like I have to
Like an exorcism

I guess that makes me sound crazy
But that’s alright
Lately I feel like I might be
Not that I’ve heard any voices or anything

Just like that everyday kind
Where you forget things you shouldn’t
And you think too much about death

Maybe you know what I’m talking about?
Or maybe you would have known?
Or had known? Is it once knew?
I don’t know what tense to use

I know I never used to feel like this
I used to never think of death or hear voices
I used to feel like everything was perfectly in order
A normal life, but I guess then came a departure

That I know you understand
Or would’ve understood
I guess things changed after that
And I’m mostly scared now

But it’s there in the stories
Or whatever they are
You can see it
Anybody could, if they could look

I wrote some notes in the
Margins explaining it
The rest is in between lines
Or in the fine print

First, the feeling of abandonment
Then trying to cope
Then death and hope and the thing itself
Waiting for me

It’s all there in the pages
Ahead of here
It’s there, waiting for you
Or for me; I’m not sure

The whole story

For everything
For everything

1263,a Letter,La Dispute,"Everybody wants a reason for everything
It’s so much easier with someone or something to blame
I’ve always struggled at the root of the problem
Has it been absence or my constant lack of defense?

I’ve never spent a lot on finding a remedy
I guess I figured that it hurt for a reason, I guess
That’s why I’ve always turned to writing it down
Not just in stories, but the letters in between, and

I guess that’s why it haunts the pages of everything
To self-examine

I think the thing is that I shut off from everything
From friends and family and my own ambitions
From having fun; I just shut off from everything
Self-defeating? Yeah, probably, but I don’t

Know that I had total control over it
And I’m not sure it even matters why
Sometimes things happen and you can’t do anything
Plus, I’m the only one who deals with it anyway

So if everyone could do me a favor and just
Put their fingers down, I’d — and keep your mouths

Sorry, I know I seem angry. I’m not, I…;
I promise, I just know I did this to me
And I will deal with it accordingly, and I
Don’t need opinions from those never a part of it

Don’t need them pointing out my problems, they’re mine
Don’t need reminders; I know better than anyone
And yeah I know, I should be finding another way
I know that I should be out seeking a substitute

But just forgetting never really made sense to me
So I haven’t been

Do I feel embarrassed about it?
I think you know the answer to that
I think you’d probably feel a little bit
Embarrassed for me, wouldn’t you?

I know I should’ve moved on ages ago
Been happy already, but
It’s never been that easy for me
Or maybe it was me that made it so hard

I know I’ve only ever tried a handful of times
To sever this thing torturing me
It never got me anywhere
With anyone; no friendship or hobby, no lover’s bed worked

But looking back I maybe never tried hard enough
And it is my fault
Maybe I never tried at all

1264,a Poem,La Dispute,"Third time writing you a letter
Getting darker
I’m getting worse
And worse

I had a reason for the writing
But trying to exorcise my demons didn’t work
To try to rid me of the worry and to purge
You out of wonder for the future and the hurt
I wrote a poem

I’m increasingly aware
I’ve been painting things in gray
I’m increasingly alarmed by the pain
I’m increasingly alive
To every cloud up in the sky
I’m increasingly afraid it’s gonna rain

See, lately I’ve
Hated me, for over-playing pain
For always pointing fingers out
At everyone, but who in fact is guilty

And for picking at my scabs
Like they could never break
But they can and they will
And I’ll spill like a leak in the basement

A drunk in the night choir
Just slur all those words
To make deadbeat that
Sweet old refrain

Self-inflicting my pain
And therein lies the real shame
I heard when they were
Picking through the rubble

Finding limbs, they sang hymns
But now what of what I see?

The worry, the wonder
The shortness of days
The replacement for purpose
The things swept away

By the worry, the wonder
My slightness of frame
The replacements for feeling
The casual lay

And the worst of the wildlife
Wears clothes and can pray
And the worry, the wonder
For three meals a day

Only death unimpeded
Not slowing it’s pace
Brings that petty, old worry
And wonder away

1265,all our bruised bodies and the whole heart shrinks,La Dispute,"So now, tell me how your story goes
Have you ever suffered?
If so, did you get better or have you
Never quite recovered from it?

Did you find your lover laying
In your bedroom with another and then
Did you let it hover over you
And everything else well after the fact?

Show me all your bruises
I know everybody wears them
They broadcast the pain
How you hurt, how you reacted

Did cancer take your child?
Did your father have a heart attack?
Have you had a moment force
The whole heart to grow or retract?

Or just shrink
Does the heart shrink?

Tell me everything
Tell me everything you know

Were you told as a child
How cruel the whole world can be?
Did anybody ever tell you that?

Tell me what your purpose is?
Who it was that put you here, and why?
Did anybody really put you here at all?

And what of those necessities?
Like how to cope with tragedy and pain?
Did anybody ever show you how?

When it hits, will my heart burst or break or grow strong?
Is there really only one way to know now?

I’m not sure if I’m ready yet to find out the hard way
How strong I am, what I’m made of
I’m not sure I am ready yet to walk through the fire
I’m not sure I can handle it

Do you think if the heart keeps on shrinking
One day there will be no heart at all?
And how long does it take?
Am I better off just bursting or breaking?
’Cause I don’t see my heart getting strong

Tell your stories to me, show your bruises
Let’s see what humanity is capable of handling
She lost her kid, only seven, to cancer
She answered with faith in her god and carried on, while

He was attacked by his son and was stabbed
In his stomach and his back and his arms, he showed me scars
82 years old, told me, ""I still have my daughter and my wife
And I still have my life and my son""

Tell me what your worst fears are
I bet they look a lot like mine
Tell me what you think about
When you can’t fall asleep at night

Tell me that you’re struggling
Tell me that you’re scared
No, tell me that you’re terrified of life
Tell me that it’s difficult
To not think of death sometimes

Tell me how you lost
Tell me how he left
Tell me how she left
Tell me how you lost everything that you had
Tell me it ain’t ever coming back

Tell me about God
Tell me about love
Tell me that it’s all of the above
Say you think of everything in fear
I bet you’re not the only one who does

Everyone in the world comes at some point to suffering
I wonder when I will, I wonder
Everyone is out searching for someone or something
I wonder what I’ll find, I wonder

Everyone in the world comes at some point to suffering
I wonder when I will, I wonder
Everyone is out searching for someone or something
I wonder what I’ll find, I wonder

I wonder what I’ll find, I wonder
I wonder what I’ll find
I wonder what I’ll find
I wonder what I’ll find

1266,Edit Your Hometown,La Dispute,"An outcry
To lost dreams and the sense of wonder
To the streets that raised him, say goodbye
To the hope for the home he’d been holding
Say goodbye and be gone and be great

To the friends who left when they still could
For the ones who chose to stay
To waste away unplaced
Alone and pray
To get out, to grow old, to grow strong

And leave this city
So familiar
All its places
All these memories
Turn each day more to gray

More they space out till it’s
Once a year we’ll catch up
Maybe less
Or else just daydreams
While he’s working late

Thinks only of those friends
And when they left
Are we still friends
At all, my friends?
Can I leave?

Rewind and find a younger man
All hopes and goals and dreams alight
And bright with friendship
At the crossroads in the night

""Now make a choice""
The city said
We were barely twenty then
But while I swore it my allegiance
They chose leaving, all my friends

And now it’s letters
Maybe phone calls
That come less and less each year
All addressed with wives and children
To the fool who chose to stay here

And it hurts me to know I’m alone now
And it’s worse when I know that I chose it
Don’t make the same mistake as me
Don’t make the same mistake

And now my friends have all left
Or it’s been me gone all along?

I guess we all part one day
And drop like leaves into the breeze
And ain’t it wild?
Ain’t it bitter?
Didn’t it carry you from me?

But it’s the coping with my fear
That keeps me here, see, once it’s gone
Do I regret you?
You can’t retrieve it
Can I forget you?

I still believe
I might get left here
I might turn 63
Still sweeping up the gutters in the street
Or weeding concrete

Wait and see
We’ll wait and see
Or rather, I will
Only me
Only me

Don’t make the same mistake as me
Don’t make the same mistake
Don’t make the same mistake as me
Say goodbye and be gone and be great
And be done and be free

1267,"Edward Benz, 27 Times",La Dispute,"I heard the old man’s voice break
Stutter once then stop it, I heard
A sentence started confidently
Halted by the sudden absence of a word

Stumbled and he sputtered, trying to find it back
Something once so simple gone now
When he finally gave up, told me
""Aw, it’s like hell getting old""

When you came into the store
Did you know you’d show me your scars?

I had a heavy heart
He carried a door
It’s shattered pane all wrapped in plastic
And he asked if I could fix it

Come by a little later
Help him put it back on hinges
""See, I’m far too old to lift it
And it’s not for my house, it’s my son’s""

When you opened up the door
What is it you thought you’d find?

Nobody flinch

Later I came by
And backed into the driveway
Got out to find him waiting there
To lead me through the side yard

To back behind the house
Where the door frame stood empty and
Helped me keep it steady
While I hammered all the pins in

Then later on the porch
We somehow got to talking
He told me of the house
And how his son is schizophrenic

So they purchased it for him
The medication working
And they figured it would help him fit in
Help him lead a normal life

But the pills made him sleep too much
And he couldn’t keep a job as a result
So one day he just gave up on taking them
And that day she had called you
He’d locked her outside of the house

How quickly did you get there?
And what were you thinking while walking up?
What fears flashed in front of you
Taunted you, walking to unlock the door?

I remember it, Ed
That story you told me
Came back clear tonight
Here while writing

And you should know the feeling never left me
The weight of my heart
When you showed me the scars
On your arms

When I looked in your eyes
And I heard what you’d said
How you’d probably would’ve died
Were it not for to care

For your daughter and wife
How he drove in the knife
Still your son
How you seemed to look through me

To some old projector screen
Playing back the scene as you
Described it on a movie reel
As real as the minute when it happened

That memory moving behind me
That moment that changed you for good

And he drove to the house
And pulled into the driveway
Got out to his wife
Waiting, frantic

She’d come by to check
Found the pillbox was empty
Went out to the pharmacy
To fill up his prescription

And came back to a locked door
And could not get back in
She’d knocked and she’d knocked
But he wasn’t responding

You put the key into the lock
And turned it
Felt the bolt slide away
Slowly open

Went into the hall
His son held a knife
Standing off in the shadows
Lunged forward and tackled him

Stabbing him over and over
And breaking that window
He fled up the staircase
The ambulance came

Stitched and filled him with blood
While the cops took his son
With his wires so tangled
His father was a stranger

And I sit in my apartment
I’m getting no answers
I’m finding no peace
No release from the anger

I leave it at arms length
I’m keeping my distance
From hotels and Jesus
And blood on the carpet

I’m stomaching nothing
I’m reaching for no one
I’m leaving this city and
I’m headed out to nowhere

I carry your image
Your grandfather’s coffin
And Ed, if you hear me
I think of you often

That’s all I can offer
That’s all that I know how to give

1268,Harder Harmonies,La Dispute,"Like a shadow on a shadow
A phantom in a film strip
Faint glimmer of the past
Trapped in mother’s old slides

Sits still in the apartment
While sifting through some pictures
Of the child that he once was
And the sense of hope they framed

""It’s a shame""
And I fear that fate
While the humming from the street
Keeps me awake

He says, ""I let life get twisted
Get worn out, torn up
And late with the rent
And now nothing makes sense

Except the bench and that piano
A feeling nearing order when I’m
Pressing down the chords""
And he plays

And it swells and breaks
But what’ll it take to make
My life sound like that

And brings a fever
A dream of sweat and ecstasy
A kiss on every hammer hit
That follows as the keys fall

Down and bring an order first
Then chaos, then a calm
That paints every shift in
Murals on the wall

And it presses to your neck
It clutches to your hips
Softly sings to you of fireworks
And God and art and sex

And it’s strange
That it feels so right
When nothing else does

But all the while he’s playing
There’s a humming coming up
And through the window from outside

And even he has to admit
A certain melody in it
But then, why can’t he harmonize?

It’s like the city’s got its own song
But he can’t play along
He sees the notes as they fly by
But always plays them wrong

And in the bathroom, it gets blurry
Gets warm and distorted
Like light pushed through the orange
Of the pillbox he poured in his palm

It falls to the floor
He smiles as it hits
Sounds a little like an instrument

Like a voice in the choir
That hum and that drumbeat
Of life as an art-form
And fire through the streets

That keep moving us in silence
To phantom baton sweeps
Keep tapping to the tempo of our feet

And all the ones
Who seem to fit
The best into the chorus
Never notice there’s a song

And the ones who seem to hear it
End up tortured by the chords
When they fail to find
A way to sing along

And when you sing the wrong thing
It all starts collapsing
Starts to ring out and feedback
Starts lapsing and crashing

On notes that don’t clash
But that never quite feel like they match
And I never quite feel like mine match

There’s a melody in everything
I’m trying to find a harmony
But nothing seems to work
Nothing seems to fit

There’s a melody in everything
I’m trying to find a harmony
But nothing seems to work
Nothing seems to fit

There’s a melody in everything
I’m trying to find a harmony
But nothing seems to work
Nothing fits

1269,I See Everything,La Dispute,"Like any morning of my
Junior year
I stumble in the classroom
Late, but this day I see
Faces, I feel
An air like a funeral
Like a wake
As I sit down

Teacher speaking
Somewhat sombrely
But still confident and calm
Part eulogy
Her speech, and
Part poem, part celebration song

Her warmth and smile
She passes photocopies
Out to us of entries
From a journal
Kept so long ago
She starts to read
And suddenly
It’s 1980

March 5
The cancer is furious
But our son is resilient
We have all the faith
We’ll get through this
No matter what the end
Treatments are violent but
He keeps on smiling
It’s amazing
Finding joy in the little things

April 12
Andrew’s appetite’s improved
And we thank God everyday
But still it’s hard sometimes
To see him in that scarecrow frame

July 9
There’s a suffering
When I look in his eyes
He’s been through so much
We’ve all been through so much, but
What incredible resolve
Our little boy shows, only 7
Standing face to face with death
He said it’s easy to find people
Who have suffered worse than him
""Like Jesus suffered worse than anyone""
He told me last night
""When God abandoned him"", and

September 20
We’ve been playing in the yard
Lately his spirits are high
Although his blood counts aren’t

October 14
He feels tired all the time

November 30
At the hospital again
It feels like home when we’re here

December 8
He’s getting worse…;

January 19
We buried our son today
Our youngest child
And while his death was ugly
We must not
Let it scare us from God
Abundant grace has restored him
A brand new body
And set him free from the torture
Finally rid of the cancer
Before the moment he left
He briefly wrested from death
Suddenly opened his eyes
Said, ""I see everything""
""I see everything""

And I will never forget it
The peace and the comfort
You displayed through a pain
That I can only imagine

The loss of a child
To the torture of cancer
Help me

’Cause I can only imagine
How you recovered
Kept your faith
And held the brightness of life
Inside the smile of a child
You had to bury

And I will never forget him
Or your steadfast faith
No I will never forget you
Now six or seven years later

I’m devoid of all faith
I am empty of comfort
And I am weary of waiting
Though I’ve felt nowhere what you have
I see nothing at all
Though I’ve felt nowhere what he did
My eyes are closed

1270,King Park,La Dispute,"Another shooting on the south-east side
This a drive-by, mid-day
Outside of the bus stop
By Fuller and Franklin, or near there
Not far from the park
About a block from where
The other shooting was last month
Or was it last week?

Shots were fired from an SUV
Heading northbound, Eastown
The target, a rival
But they didn’t hit the target this time
They hit a kid we think
Had nothing to do with it

And I travel backwards
Through time and space, and
I disintegrate, become invisible
I want to see it
Where I couldn’t when it happened
I want to see it all
First hand this time
I want to know what it felt like

So I float behind police lines
Reconstruct the scene in fragments of memories
I want to know what his mother looked like up close
I want to see her leaning over his body
So I float there, transcend time
I want to capture it accurately
I want to know what the color of the blood was
Spilling out from the tarp onto the concrete

I want to write it all down
So I can always remember
If you could see it up close
How could you ever forget
How senseless death
How precious life
I want to be there
When the bullet hit

And the crowd poured out
As the shots drowned
Into siren sounds
Out of their houses now
And over front yards
All the way up to the place
Where the police tape ran
To mark the crime scene

Everybody trying to catch a glimpse
Of what was happening, of what was going on
Between the ambulance, and all the cop cars
Everybody gossiping, ""Whose kid got hit?
Where’d it hit him, and who could’ve fired it?""
Everybody wondering, ""How did it happen again?
And is he dead? These children, our kids""

Everybody wondering how far they were
From where the victims lived
And I visit them, their houses
Inside my dream I visit them
My spirit, soaring high and high
Up over King Park, leaves the crime scene
Travels further back, till far before the shooting
Through their windows, to their living rooms

I see them younger this time
Playing games and doing homework
All these marks of youth
Soon transformed coldly into stone
For fights and stupid feuds
For ruins wrapped in gold, and

Cruelly, I recall
Why I have come
To find a reason
But there cannot be a reason
Not for death, not like this
Not like this

Three days later, they made funeral plans
The family
Three days later, a mother
Had to bury her son

Not far away, the shooter
Holed up in a hotel
Near to the highway
With a friend and the gun
That same gun

He’d fled immediately
But was identified by witnesses
His picture on TV
Only 20 years old; they called him Grandpa
He was older than the others
By a year, maybe two, and
He was safe for awhile
Until somebody saw him there

And notified the authorities
Who surrounded the hotel
First arresting an accomplice
While attempting to flee
Then chasing him up the staircase
To the floor where he’d stayed
He closed the door hard behind him
Locked himself in the room

They could’ve kicked in the door
But knew the gun was still with him
One he’d already used
And so they feared what he’d do
I floated up through the window
Of a room to the west
I hovered out to the hallway
Tried to listen in

I heard them trying to reason
Get him to open the door
His uncle begging and pleading
Half-collapsed to the floor
He preached of hope and forgiveness
Said, ""There is always a chance
To rectify what you’ve taken
Make your peace in the world""

I thought to slip through the door
I could’ve entered the room
I felt the burden of murder
It shook the earth to the core
Felt like the world was collapsing
Then we heard him speak

""Can I still get into heaven if I kill myself?
Can I still get into heaven if I kill myself?
Can I ever be forgiven cause I killed that kid?
It was an accident, I swear it wasn’t meant for him!

And if I turn it on me, if I even it out
Can I still get in or will they send me to hell?
Can I still get into heaven if I kill myself?""
I left the hotel behind, don’t want to know how it ends

1271,St. Paul Missionary Baptist Church Blues,La Dispute,"Stained-glass and the choir sing out
That strong and ceaseless chorus here
So sweet the voices, sweep like
Leaves into the street, on Easter
A celebration, carried on
For God and hope and refuge
To keep each other, life
Give shelter from the storm (And keep warm)

The congregation gathers
Outside in the parking lot
Each service done, they keep the old hymn
Rolling on and on, and
I see the scene in color each day
Driving out to Eastown
That old abandoned church
And have I gone the same sad way?

Have I gone the same sad way?

Through the sixties flourished
And the seventies did flux
The eighties fluctuate each year
Unclear when the money would dry up
And when the nineties
Violent crime and rising
Unemployment rates came by
That parking lot grew dim and thin
Of sinners and saints

Until the voices
Unceasing, slowly faded to black
Until the weeds stormed the concrete
From unattended cracks
It had to know, had to feel that glory
Never coming back
Like I could feel it when the passion left
The last of what I had
It had to know

Like I knew
And I can’t find it back
Might not ever

Ten years now, standing vacant
Ten years on empty, maybe more
Once held the faith of hundreds
Soon one more cell phone store

For years, they gathered here
Inside the building, sound and true
To sing their praises to a god
That gave them hope, to carry on
To carry through

So I’ve been thinking about that
Sometimes go slow when I drive by
How a home of stone and a house so holy
Grows so empty over time

What gave those people purpose
Past death approaching constantly
Now left to crumble slowly
Now left to wither with the weeds

Now left to ice and vandals
The advent candles long since gone
The old foundation shifting hard
The concrete overgrown, but

That stained-glass window
Sits untouched amongst the brickwork worn
A symbol of the beauty
Only perfect at that moment we were born

And just the other day
I swear I saw a man there
Pulling weeds out of the concrete
Sweeping up and patching cracks

I saw him lift a rag to
Wash the years of
Filth from off those windows
Made me wonder if there’s
Anyone like that
For you and me
And anybody else
Who broke and lost hope

1272,The Most Beautiful Bitter Fruit,La Dispute,"After sundown, before sleeping
I am the worst of me
I am a mess of these
Old themes and the murmur of half-dreams
Whisper seductively
And stage scenes, it’s

Fear fiction, these visions
Caught somewhere between delusion and prophesy
What I haven’t done
What I’ve wanted to
And what I fear you have
Becomes reality here

Bright lights in the young night
Keep to the beat
A classic party scene
Crowded and interesting
No love, no life, no history
Just touch, just chemistry, just

A roaring undercurrent
Simple and sensory
Young bodies, warm skin
Perfect symmetry and
It’s a moment
Harmless; it’s energy

It’s like medicine
It’s self-discovery, see
All the secrets I keep
Why are they secrets?

It’s only temporary
That fleeting feeling of warmth
Just a flash before the line gets blurry
Between a longing for more
Than what the body wants now and
What the body wants now more than anything?

Was it integrity
That kept my hands to myself
Or just the thought of getting
Too far ahead of you?
Was it that I got too tired of the consequence?
Or was I just scared?

I only know I never wanted to get left behind
No pauses, not a second guess
First a swaying, then a stumble, then a swagger
They’re just movements
Towards feeling
It doesn’t matter, neither hesitates to carry on

A kind of energy, sweat and block out everything to
Find every aperture and compel the animal parts
Fan flames, taste fruit, taste bitter fruit
Just trying to learn how all the wires in the body work
Just trying to feel it out, it’s like medicine
Find the healing in whatever bed they end up in

I want to feel it out
I want to know how it works
I want to know if it was worth it to worry
About the ghosts I feared
Would haunt the memory
About the damage that I’m sure the fear has done to me now

I want to know what it is
In me that won’t follow through
Those nights the instinct
Takes a hold of me and pushes too
Maybe it’s only that I’ve never gotten over you
Or am I still scared?

I see the church steps
A vision
Is there fiction in this one too? It’s true
I’ve made a tale of it here
Still it’s a little unclear
Who’s been haunting who

And time can
Be such a funny thing
Always moving to the future
Glorifying the past
And amplifying the pain
In frames of glass

So was our touch half as sacred as I’ve made it seem
Or just another fabrication of a half-dream?
Just those chemicals, the adolescent love
Just us trying to grasp onto meaning

Onto a purpose
Onto a sense that
Something spiritual releases when the feeling hits
And when the feeling hits

And in that moment, sparks and harps play out
A sweeping melody through fog and fantasy
And in that moment there’s an honesty instinctive and pure
But it departs like it came
Rapid and bearing no more
Than fleeting ecstasy of natural harmony

They fear the notes being played
And try to sing along
Don’t be ashamed, be free to the feeling
Don’t be ashamed, keep feeling
But find it, a body that makes sense
I’ve felt it

1273,You and I in Unison,La Dispute,"What will I find?
Some sacred thing
To help me handle the tragedy?
Or did I once
Did I have it and lose it?

No one should ever have to walk through the fire alone
No one should ever have to brave that storm, no
Everybody
Needs someone or something

And when I sing
Don’t I sing your name out
Right at the same time
That I sing my own?

Some days, I swear I can feel you
Splitting the light through the window frame
The shapes it makes
Are always warmer, always brighter
Than the rest of what comes through

Some days, I swear I can hear you sing
To me, or whisper my name in the slightest way
It’s like the warmest light now laid across my bedroom floor
Is somehow actually you
And not just sunlight

I have the memory, climb down the balcony
I put a flower on the back of its dress, it’s
Probably best to forget it
It’s probably best to let go

I paint it the shade of where the skin and the lip meet
Only a moment after breaking the kiss, and
I blur out everything else
That’s how I choose to remember it

Some nights are a lot like the days, I lay awake too late
I watch the shadows cast and trace your shape
Those silver slivers on the wall, then on the bedsheets
I hear your song in the trees
I finally fall into rest

Often later when I’m sleeping you show up in my dreams
Just doing simple things, like buying groceries, and
When I wake up, I could swear you must’ve just left me
Like you got up to get breakfast
Or maybe just to get dressed

But the truth is
You were never there, you won’t ever be
Sometimes I think I’m not either
So what do I do
When every day still seems to start and end with you?

And you won’t ever know
You won’t ever see
How much your ghost since then
Has been defining me

I leave the memory up atop the balcony
I tear this flower from the back of the dress
It’s best this time, I bet
To just forget and let go

Paint it the shade of where the lip bleeds and blur it out
I blur out everything else
Just blur out everything else
And let go, and let go, and let go

Everybody has to let go someday
Everybody has to let go
I wonder when I will, I wonder

But if I still hear you singing in every city I’m in
After I blur it all out, our every memory, if
You never fade with the days, your shape still haunting me then
Should I not just sing along?
Should I not just sing along?

I will sing sweetly
Hope that the notes change but
I do not need it to happen
I’m not resigned to it

And if they never do
I’ll sing your name in every line
Just like I did throughout this
Just like I’ve always done

In every gun, the empty church
And every tortured son
In all those giving up
In all those giving in

Until I die I will sing our names in unison
Until I die I will sing our names in unison
Until I die, until I

1274,Ashes of the Wake,Lamb of God,"We killed a lot of innocent civilians.
To us every civilian in Baghdad was a terrorist.
They said ""they are now in civilian clothes"" that makes everybody free game,
But if they came in our perimeter, we lit ’em up.
And when we would pull the body out, and when we would search the car, we would find nothing.
This took place time and time again. No harm, no foul, that’s okay, don’t worry about it,
Because this is a new type of war, this is an eradication.

I honestly feel we’re committing genocide over here,
I don’t believe in killing civilians, and I’m not going to kill civilians for the United States Marine Corps.

1275,Blood Of The Scribe,Lamb of God,"All of this comes crashing down
Cornerstone’s gone
Sleepless
Hopeless
No end in sight

Ink well
Has run dry
Fill it with
Blood of the scribe

Rest comes easy to the guiltless…
The vampire laments as he prays for the sun.
Doom, despair, tragedy are the tools of the trade

Cut to the bone, rob the grave
Unearth the stone, lay to waste
Defile the tome, rip the page
Strip mine the vein, lay to waste

Frayed at the edge, flat lined
The anvil cracks, the hammer
Relentlessly comes down
A new pariah is born

Cut to the bone, rob the grave
Unearth the stone, lay to waste
Defile the tome, rip the page
Strip mine the vein, lay to waste

Chastisement lays you down to sleep
Tucks you in with bloody kisses
Gifts of nightmares bitter sweet

Type A negative shuts me down
Catch phrase will be death of me
Is this not what you came to see?
What, are you not entertained?

Climb the walls ’til nails bleed
Rip the hair, tear the seams
Break the glass, head in hands
Bell tolls endlessly, no end in sight

1276,Break You,Lamb of God,"Endless mornings cut by the dawn razor
Whipping the nightmares to a froth
Endless questions with no answers
No replacement for what’s been lost
Lost

Everything suffocates in the dust of past
Fortunes squandered
The empire of lies to whom you pandered

Suffer a self-imposed exile
Taste the bitter fruits of denial
In the presence of greatness
The humble can only bow

Frost on the breath of life
Empty of warmth or light
Full of nothing but deprivation
Eternal winter

Frost on the breath of life
Empty of warmth or light
Full of eternal winter

Tell me a lie with the best of intentions
Mute in the age of mass communication
Dark days lead to darker nights
Frozen, out of time
It dies for blessed ego
The once mighty laid low

Frost on the breath of life
Empty of warmth or light
Full of nothing but deprivation
Full of nothing but deprivation
Eternal winter

Full of nothing but deprivation
Eternal winter

You taught me hate
I’ll teach you fear
Open the eyes
Kill despair

You tried to squeeze the life from me

Break you, I’m going to break you (break you)

1277,Hourglass,Lamb of God,"Privileged
A chosen few
Blessed with our time in hell
Witness a divine vision
The day we all fell still
Rapture of the dying age
A shattered hourglass
Wrath of the warring gods and so this too shall pass
It’s only getting worse
Not worth a moments regret
Each dawn another curse
Every breath a twisting blade
What will be left behind in the ashes of the wake

An ill wind blows this way
The edge of the envelope burns
Forbearance and my vengeance
Payment for your intent
Fear and death in the wings
In thrall of those fallen from grace
Petty is as petty does
Witness the mass disgrace
God forbid you read the signs
Watch for meanings between the lines

Gehenna has now arrived
No hindsight for the blind
Your trust has been misplaced
Believed the lies told to your face
Became another casualty and now it’s too late
You finally made it home
Draped in the flag that you fell for
And so it goes
The ashes of the wake
Its only getting worse

1278,Laid to Rest,Lamb of God,"If there was a single day I could live
A single breath I could take
I’d trade all the others away

The blood’s on the wall
So you might as well just admit it
And bleach out the stains
Commit to forgetting it

You’re better off empty and blank
Than left with a single pathetic trace of this
Smother another failure
Lay this to rest

Console yourself
You’re better alone
Destroy yourself
See who gives a fuck

Absorb yourself
You’re better alone
Destroy yourself

I’ll chain you to the truth
For the truth shall set you free
I’ll turn the screws of vengeance
And bury you with honesty

I’ll make all your dreams come to life
Then slay them as quickly as they came
Smother another failure
Lay this to rest

Console yourself

Imperial
Lust for blood
A blind crusade
Apocalyptic

Bombs to set the people free
Blood to feed the dollar tree
Flags for coffins on the screen
Oil for the machine
Army of liberation
Gunpoint indoctrination
The fires of sedition
Fulfill the prophecy

Now you’ve got something to die for

Send the children to the fire
Sons and daughters stack the pyre
Stoke the flame of the empire
Live to lie another day
Face of hypocrisy
Raping democracy

Until we’ve dug our own grave
And drug the rest down with us
The burning home of the brave

1280,Omerta,Lamb of God,"Whoever appeals to the law against his fellow man is either a fool or a coward.
Whoever cannot take care of himself without that law is both.
For a wounded man shall say to his assailant: ""If I live, I will kill you. If I die, you are forgiven.""
Such is the Rule of Honor.

Broken the paradigm
An example must be set
Invoke the siren song and sign the death warrant
This is what has been wrought for thirty pieces of silver
The tongues of men and angels bought by a beloved betrayer

I am the result what’s better left unspoken
Violence begins to mend what was broken
You’ve been talking
I’ve been all ears

Words meant to dwell in darkness shall never see the light of day
Words can be broken, so can bones
Execute the mandate
Mouth full of dirt, your name is removed from the registry
St. Peter greets with empty eyes, then turns and locks the gate

I am the result what’s better left unspoken
Violence begins to mend what was broken
You’ve been talking
I’ve been all ears

Omerta

Cheaply venal, stupidly verbose
A slip of the tongue, a slit of the throat
Six feet under with no marker
Keep my name from your mouth forever
Free speech for the living
Dead men tell no tales
Your laughing finger will never point again

Omerta

Sing for me now

They’ll hallow your name

The sins of deliverance

""So let the wicked perish in the presence of God""
For your sacrifice

The sins of the father atoned by the son
Confessions of commitments broken
A nail driven for every one
It’s when murder is justice that martyrs are made
A one-gun salute for the new independence day

1282,Remorse Is for the Dead,Lamb of God,"The dirty lord of the manor surveys his filthy domain
Too many nights raising hell worked a little all too well
Constructed a monument to denial and excess
Sunk so low, crawled so far back there’s nowhere left to regress
If these walls could talk, they would tell a horror story
Never-ending winter, violence and infidelity
Shadows fall through broken panes
Careless words that are filled with hate
Just enough to keep it together, never enough to make it work
All the tongues here are forked
We are a hailstorm of broken glass
Follow the path of least expectance

A huge stinking pile of sick

Pile it higher and higher
Light the match, start the fire
Level this place until nothing’s left and take us with it

Surroundings are irate
Crack of dawn brings naught but pain
Resentment steadily grows, laughing in the gallows

Full throttle determined to fail
Pedal to the metal asleep at the wheel
We are the lucky ones, welcome home

Pile it higher and higher
Light the match, start the fire
Level this place until nothings left and take us with it

Poisoned nerves and a bloody antidote
Violence is not an aberration, it’s a rule
Dying beyond the pale
Your beatings will continue until my morale improves
I don’t hate you, I’m just removing an enemy
Remorse is for the dead

I’m just removing an enemy
Remorse is for the dead, my enemy

Of promises I made
So faithless
The tenants long betrayed

Walk the faded line
Cursed crawl of time
Silence
The only promise ever kept

Familiar touch
A ritual to numb the cut
Salvation in vice
Anguish is realizing what could have been
But never was
It’s emptiness that fills the cup
Devotion in the method of my fall

Futility continuing
Endless
Flowing in corrupted vein

Amazing disgrace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
Better lost if this is found
Best blinded, never to see

Intertwined
Take your place in the line to be ground by the gears of the masterpiece
Betrayal

1298,Waiting for the End,Linkin Park,"This is not the end, this is not the beginning
Just a voice like a riot rocking every revision
But you listen to the tone and the violent rhythm
And though the words sound steady, something empty’s within them
We say yeah, with fists flying up in the air
Like we’re holding onto something that’s invisible there
’Cause we’re living at the mercy of the pain and the fear
Until we dead it, forget it, let it all disappear

Waiting for the end to come
Wishing I had strength to stand
This is not what I had planned
It’s out of my control

Flying at the speed of light
Thoughts were spinning in my head
So many things were left unsaid
It’s hard to let you go

I know what it takes to move on
I know how it feels to lie
All I want to do is trade this life for something new
Holding on to what I haven’t got

Sitting in an empty room
Trying to forget the past
This was never meant to last
I wish it wasn’t so

I know what it takes to move on
I know how it feels to lie
All I want to do is trade this life for something new
Holding on to what I haven’t got

What was left when that fire was gone
I thought it felt right, but that right was wrong
All caught up in the eye of the storm
And trying to figure out what it’s like moving on
And I don’t even know what kind of things I said
My mouth kept moving and my mind went dead
So, I’m picking up the pieces now, where to begin
The hardest part of ending is starting again

All I want to do is trade this life for something new

I am not a pattern to be followed
The pill that I’m on is a tough one to swallow
I’m not a criminal, not a role model
Not a born leader, I’m a tough act to follow
I am not the fortune and the fame
Nor the same person telling you to forfeit the game
I came in the ring like a dog on a chain
And I found out the underbelly’s sicker than it seems
And it seems ugly, but it can get worse
’Cause even a blueprint is a gift and a curse
’Cause once you got a theory of how the thing works
Everybody wants the next thing to be just like the first
And I’m not a robot, I’m not a monkey
I will not dance, even if the beat’s funky
Opposite of lazy, far from a punk
You all ought to stop talking
Start trying to catch up, motherfucker

Lauryn said money change a situation
Big said it increase the complication
Kane said ""Don’t step. I ain’t the one.""
Chuck said that Uzi weigh a motherfucking ton
And I’m just a student of the game that they taught me
Rocking every stage in every place that it brought me
I’m awfully underrated, but came here to correct it
And so it ain’t mistaken, I’mma state it for the record
I am
The opposite of wack
Opposite of weak
Opposite of slack
Synonym of heat
Synonym of crack
Closest to a peak

Because my conscience leaves me no other choice
A true revolution of values will lay hands on the world order and say of war
This way of settling difference is, is not just
This business of burning human beings with napalm
Filling our nation’s homes with orphans and widows
Of injecting poisonous drugs of hate into veins of peoples normally humane
Of sending men home from the dark and bloody battlefields
Physically handicapped and psychologically deranged

Upon the levers, upon all the apparatus
And you’ve got to make it stop

To save face, how low can you go

The people up top push the people down low
Get down
And obey every word
Steady getting mine if you haven’t yet heard
Wanna take what I got, don’t be absurd
Don’t fight the power, nobody gets hurt
If you haven’t heard yet then I’m letting you know

And no one make a move unless my people say so
Got everything outta control
Now everybody go

Steel unload, final blow
We the animals, take control
Hear us now, clear and true

So keep pace, how slow can you go
Talk a lot of shit and yet you don’t know
Fire on the way, make you all say whoa
The people up top and the people down low
Get down
And I’m running it like that
The front of the attack is exactly where I’m at
Somewhere in-between, the kick and the hi-hat
The pen and the contract, the pitch and the contact
So get with the combat, I’m letting ’em know
There ain’t shit you can say to make me back down no
So push the button let the whole thing blow
Spinning everything outta control
Now everybody go

Steel unload, final blow
We the animals, take control
Hear us now, clear and true
Wretches and kings we come for you

Steel unload, fire blow
Filthy animals, beat them low
Skin and bone, black and blue
No more this sun shall beat onto you

If you fear what I feel put ’em up real high
Front to the back and the side to side

Shining with the light from the sun
The sun doesn’t give life to the moon
Assuming the moon’s going to owe it one
It makes me think of how you act to me
You do favors and then rapidly
You just turn around and start asking me
About things that you want back from me
I’m sick of the tension, sick of the hunger
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed
While I find a place to rest.

I want to be in another place
I hate when you say you don’t understand
(You’ll see it’s not meant to be)
I want to be in the energy, not with the enemy
A place for my head.

Maybe someday I’ll be just like you and
Step on people like you do
And run away all the people I thought I knew
I remember back then who you were
You used to be calm, used to be strong
Used to be generous, but you shoulda known
That you’d wear out your welcome
And now you see how quiet it is, all alone.

Do I follow my instincts blindly?
Do I hide my pride from these bad dreams?
And give in to sad thoughts that are maddening?
Do I sit here and try to stand it
Or do I try to catch them red-handed?
Do I trust some and get fooled by phoniness?
Or do I trust nobody and live in loneliness?

Then they’ll take from me ’til everything is gone

Taken far from my safety (The picture’s there)

Skies cock back and shock that which can’t defend
The rain then sends dripping, acidic questions
Forcefully, the power of suggestion
Then with the eyes shut
Looking through the rust and rot n’ dust
A small spot of light floods the floor
And pours over the rusted world of pretend
And the eyes ease open and it’s dark again

Eyes burning up
The darkness holding me tightly
Until the sun rises up

Moving all around, screaming of the ups and downs
Pollution manifested in perpetual sound
The wheels go round and the sunset creeps behind street lamps
Chain link and concrete
A little piece of paper with a picture drawn
Floats on down the street ’til the wind is gone
And the memory now is like the picture was then
When the paper’s crumpled up, it can’t be perfect again

Before the rat-race, before monkeys had human traits

So you can try on
Leave you without a shoulder to cry on
From now to infinity let icons be bygones

I tried threats but moved on to a promise
I stomp shit with or without an accomplice
And run the gauntlet with whoever that wants this

Watch it count down to the end of the day

Watched the time go right out the window

To the cold of the static and put my cold feet on the floor
Forgot all about yesterday
Remembering I’m pretending to be where I’m not anymore
A little taste of hypocrisy
And I’m left in the wake of the mistake, slow to react
E-even though you’re so close to me
You’re still so distant and I can’t bring you back

It’s true the way I feel was promised by your face
The sound of your voice painted on my memories
Even if you’re not with me
I’m with you

You, now I see
Keeping everything inside
With you
You, now I see
Even when I close my eyes

I hit you and you hit me back
We fall to the floor
The rest of the day stands still
Fine line between this and that
When things go wrong I pretend that the past isn’t real
I’m trapped in this memory
And I’m left in the wake of the mistake
Slow to react
So even though you’re close to me
You’re still so distant
And I can’t bring you back

1331,Figure.09,Linkin Park,"Nothing ever stops all these thoughts and the pain attached to them
Sometimes I wonder why this is happening
It’s like nothing I could do would distract me when
I think of how I shot myself in the back again
Because from the infinite words I could say
I put all the pain you gave to me on display
But didn’t realize, instead of setting it free
I took what I hated and made it a part of me

It never goes away, never goes away

And now you’ve become a part of me, you’ll always be right here
You’ve become a part of me, you’ll always be my fear
I can’t separate myself from what I’ve done
Giving up a part of me, I’ve let myself become you

Hearing your name the memories come back again
I remember when it started happening
I’d see you in every thought I had and then
The thoughts slowly found words attached to them
And I knew as they escaped away
I was committing’ myself to them and every day
I regret saying those things because now I see
That I took what I hated and made it a part of me

It never goes away, never goes away

And now you’ve become a part of me, you’ll always be right here
You’ve become a part of me, you’ll always be my fear
I can’t separate myself from what I’ve done
Giving up a part of me, I’ve let myself become you

It never goes away, it never goes away
It never goes away, it never goes away

Get away from me
Give me my space back, you got to just go
Everything comes down to memories of you
I’ve kept it in but now I’m letting you know
I’ve let you go
So get away from me
Give me my space back, you got to just go
Everything comes down to memories of you
I’ve kept it in but now I’m letting you know
I’ve let you go

And now you’ve become a part of me, you’ll always be right here

I’ve let myself become you, I’ve let myself become lost inside these thoughts of you
Giving up a part of me, I’ve let myself become you

Trying not to break but I’m so tired of this deceit
Every time I try to make myself get back up on my feet
All I ever think about is this, all the tiring time between
And how trying to put my trust in you just takes so much out of me

I’ll take everything from the inside
And throw it all away
’Cause I swear, for the last time
I won’t trust myself with you

Too many times that I’ve held on when I needed to push away
Afraid to say what was on my mind, afraid to say what I need to say
Too many things that you’ve said about me when I’m not around
You think having the upper hand means you’ve gotta keep putting me down
But I’ve had too many stand-offs with you, it’s about as much as I can stand
So I’m waiting util the upper hand is mine

One minute you’re on top, the next you’re not, watch it drop
Making your heart stop just before you hit the floor
One minute you’re on top, the next you’re not, missed your shot
Making your heart stop, you think you’ve won and then it’s all gone

So many people like me put so much trust in all your lies
So concerned with what you think to just say what we feel inside
So many people like me walk on eggshells all day long
All I know is that all I want is to feel like I’m not stepped on
There are so many things you say that make me feel you crossed the line
What goes up will surely fall and I’m counting down the time
’Cause I’ve had so many stand-offs with you, it’s about as much as I can stand
So I’m waiting until the upper hand is mine

One minute you’re on top, the next you’re not, watch it drop

And then it’s all gone; And then it’s all gone; And then it’s all gone
Now it’s all gone

I know I’ll never trust a single thing you say
You knew your lies would divide us but you lied anyway
And all the lies have got you floating up above us all
But what goes up has got to fall

One minute you’re on top, the next you’re not, watch it drop
Making your heart stop just before you hit the floor
One minute you’re on top, the next you’re not, missed your shot
Making your heart stop, you think you’ve won and then it’s all gone

1335,Nobody's Listening,Linkin Park,"Coming at you

Peep the style and the kids checking for it
The number one question is how could you ignore it
We drop right back in the cut over basement tracks
With raps that got you backing this up like, rewind that
We’re just rolling with the rhythm
Rise from the ashes of stylistic division
With these non-stop lyrics of life living
Not to be forgotten but still unforgiven
But in the meantime there are those
Who want to talk this and that so I suppose
That it gets to a point feelings got to get hurt
And get dirty with the people spreading the dirt, it goes

I try to give you warning, but everyone ignores me
Told you everything loud and clear, but nobody’s listening
Call to you so clearly, but you don’t want to hear me
Told you everything loud and clear, but nobody’s listening

I got a heart full of pain, head full of stress
Handful of anger held in my chest
And everything left’s a waste of time
I hate my rhymes but hate everyone else’s more
I’m riding on the back of this pressure
Guessing that its better I can’t keep myself together
Because all of this stress gave me something to write on
The pain gave me something I could set my sights on
You never forget the blood, sweat, and tears
The uphill struggle over years, the fear and
Trash talking and the people it was to
And the people that started it just like you

I try to give you warning but everyone ignores me
Told you everything loud and clear, but nobody’s listening
Call to you so clearly but you don’t want to hear me
Told you everything loud and clear, but nobody’s listening

I got a heart full of pain, head full of stress
Handful of anger held in my chest
Uphill struggle, blood, sweat and tears
Nothing to gain, everything to fear
I got a heart full of pain, head full of stress
Handful of anger held in my chest
Uphill struggle, blood, sweat and tears
Nothing to gain, everything to fear
Heart full of pain, heart full of pain

I try to give you warning but everyone ignores me
Told you everything loud and clear, but nobody’s listening
Call to you so clearly but you don’t want to hear me
Told you everything loud and clear, but nobody’s listening

Every step that I take is another mistake to you
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)

I’ve become so numb, I can’t feel you there
I’ve become so tired; so much more aware
I’m becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

Can’t you see that you’re smothering me?
Holding too tightly; afraid to lose control
’Cause everything that you thought I would be
Has fallen apart right in front of you

Is the only real thing that I’ve got left to feel

Hand grenade pins in every line
Throw ’em up and let something shine
Going out of my fucking mind
Filthy mouth, no excuse
Find a new place to hang this noose
String me up from atop these roofs
Knot it tight so I won’t get loose
Truth is, you can stop and stare
Bled myself out and no one cares
Dug the trench out, laid down there
With a shovel up out of reach somewhere
Yeah, someone pour it in
Make it a dirt dance floor again
Say your prayers and stomp it out
When they bring that chorus in

I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away, just to throw it away

Choppy words and a sloppy flow
Shotgun opera, lock and load
Cock it back and then watch it go
Mama help me, I’ve been cursed
Death is rolling in every verse
Candy paint on his brand new hearse
Can’t contain him, he knows he works
Fuck this hurts, I won’t lie
Doesn’t matter how hard I try
Half the words don’t mean a thing
And I know that I won’t be satisfied

Words on loose leaf sheet, complete comin’
I jump on my mind, I summon the rhyme I’m dumpin’
Healin’ the blind, I promise to let the sun in
Sick of the dark ways we march to the drummin’

Jump when they tell us that they wanna see jumpin’
Fuck that, I wanna see some fists pumpin’
Risk somethin’, take back what’s yours
Say somethin’ that you know they might attack you for

’Cause I’m sick of being treated like I had before
Like it’s stupid standin’ for what I’m standin’ for
Like this war’s really just a different brand of war
Like it doesn’t cater to rich and abandon poor

Like they understand you, in the back of their jet
When you can’t put gas in your tank
And these fuckers are laughin’ their way to the bank, and cashin’ their cheque
Askin’ you to have compassion and have some respect

For a leader so nervous in an obvious way
Stutterin’ and mumblin’ for nightly news to replay
And the rest of the world watchin’ at the end of the day
In the living room laughin’ like, ""What did he say?""

Have to react to get blown into fractions

Ten years old, it’s somethin’ to see
Another kid my age drugged under a Jeep
Taken and bound and found later under a tree
I wonder if he had thought ’the next one could be me’

Do you see the soldiers they’re out today
They brush the dust from bulletproof vests away
It’s ironic, at times like this you’d pray
But a bomb blew the mosque up yesterday

There’s bombs on the buses, bikes, roads
Inside your market, your shops, your clothes
My dad, he’s got a lot of fear I know
But enough pride inside not to let that show

My brother had a book he would hold with pride
A little red cover with a broken spine
On the back he hand-wrote a quote inside
""When the rich wage war, it’s the poor who die""

Meanwhile, the leader just talks away
Stutterin’ and mumblin’ for nightly news to replay
The rest of the world watching at the end of the day
Both scared and angry, like ""What did he say?""

1347,Valentine's Day,Linkin Park,"My insides all turned to ash
So slow
And blew away as I collapsed
So cold
A black wind took them away
From sight
And held the darkness over day
That night

And the clouds above move closer
Looking so dissatisfied
But the heartless wind kept blowing, blowing

I used to be my own protection
But not now
’Cause my path has lost direction
Somehow
A black wind took you away
From sight
And held the darkness over day
That night

And the clouds above move closer
Looking so dissatisfied
And the ground below grew colder
As they put you down inside
But the heartless wind kept blowing, blowing

So now you’re gone
And I was wrong
I never knew what it was like
To be alone

On a Valentine’s day
On a Valentine’s day
On a Valentine’s day
On a Valentine’s day

On a Valentine’s day
(I used to be my own protection)
On a Valentine’s day
(But not now)
On a Valentine’s day
(’Cause my mind has lost direction)
On a Valentine’s day

On a Valentine’s day

1348,What I've Done,Linkin Park,"In this farewell, there’s no blood, there’s no alibi
’Cause I’ve drawn regret from the truth of a thousand lies
So let mercy come and wash away what I’ve done

I’ll face myself to cross out what I’ve become
Erase myself and let go of what I’ve done

Put to rest what you thought of me
While I clean this slate with the hands of uncertainty
So let mercy come, and wash away what I’ve done

I’ll face myself to cross out what I’ve become
Erase myself and let go of what I’ve done

For what I’ve done, I’ll start again and whatever pain may come
Today this ends, I’m forgiving what I’ve done
I’ll face myself to cross out what I’ve become
Erase myself and let go of what I’ve done

1349,Battle Symphony,Linkin Park,"I got a long way to go
And a long memory
I been searching for an answer
Always just out of reach
Blood on the floor
Sirens repeat
I been searching for the courage
To face my enemies
When they turn down the lights

I hear my battle symphony
All the world in front of me
If my armor breaks
I’ll fuse it back together
Battle symphony
Please just don’t give up on me
And my eyes are wide awake

For my battle symphony
For my battle symphony

They say that I don’t belong
Say that I should retreat
That I’m marching to the rhythm
Of a lonesome defeat
But the sound of your voice
Puts the pain in reverse
No surrender, no illusions
And for better or worse
When they turn down the lights

I hear my battle symphony
All the world in front of me
If my armor breaks
I’ll fuse it back together
Battle symphony
Please just don’t give up on me
And my eyes are wide awake

If I fall, get knocked down
Pick myself up off the ground
If I fall, get knocked down
Pick myself up off the ground
When they turn down the lights

I hear my battle symphony
All the world in front of me
If my armor breaks
I’ll fuse it back together

Pack it up and disappear
You better have some place to go
’Cause you can’t come back around here
Good goodbye
(Don’t you come back no more)

Live from the rhythm, it’s
Something wild, venomous
Enemies trying to read me
You’re all looking highly illiterate
Blindly forgetting if I’m in the mix
You won’t find an equivalent
I’ve been here killing it
Longer than you’ve been alive, you idiot
And it makes you so mad
Somebody else could be stepping in front of you
And it makes you so mad that you’re not the only one
There’s more than one of you
And you can’t understand the fact
That it’s over and done, hope you had fun
You’ve got a lot to discuss on the bus
Headed back where you’re from

So say goodbye and hit the road
Pack it up and disappear
You better have some place to go
’Cause you can’t come back around here
Good goodbye
Good goodbye
Good goodbye
Good goodbye

Goodbye, good riddance
A period is after every sentence
Did my time with my cellmate
Maxed out so now we finished
Every day was like a hail date
Every night was like a hailstorm
Took her back to my tinted windows
Showin’ out, she in rare form
Wings up, now I’m airborne
King Push, they got a chair for him
Make way for the new queen
The old lineup, where they cheer for ’em
Consequence when you ain’t there for him
Were you there for him
Did you care for him
You were dead wrong

So say goodbye and hit the road
Pack it up and disappear
You better have some place to go
’Cause you can’t come back around here
Good goodbye

(Don’t you come back no more)

Yo
Let me say goodbye to my demons
Let me say goodbye to my past life
Let me say goodbye to the darkness
Tell ’em that I’d rather be here in the starlight
Tell ’em that I’d rather be here where they love me
Tell ’em that I’m yours this is our life
And I still keep raising the bar like
Never seen a young black brother in the chart twice
Goodbye to the stereotypes
You can’t tell my kings we can’t
Mandem we’re linking tings in parks
Now I got a tune with Linkin Park
Like goodbye to my old hoe’s
Goodbye to the cold roads
I can’t die for my postcode
Young little Mike from the Gold Coast
And now I’m inside with my bro bro’s, gang

So say goodbye and hit the road
Pack it up and disappear
You better have some place to go
’Cause you can’t come back around here
Good goodbye

At least I know, somehow, I made a mark

In the dark, in the light
Nothing left, nothing right
In the dark, in the light
Nothing left, nothing right

In the dark, in the light
Nothing left, nothing right
In the dark, in the light
Nothing left, nothing right!

Nothing right!

I can’t resolve this empty story

Who’ve never faced oppression’s gun
We are the fortunate ones
Imitations of rebellion

We acted out, we wear the colors
Confined by the things we own
We’re not without, we’re like each other
Pretending we’re here alone
And far away they burn their buildings
Right in the face of the damage done

We are the fortunate ones
Who’ve never faced oppression’s gun

Means finding it alone

For laying down your life

There’s no pain, it will spare
Fear has become your only right
And once you’re lost, in your despair
Forever black eternal night

Murder with no killing, illing every direction
First, no sequel, do the math, no equal
John with no Yoko; more power, less people
And no, I’m not afraid of that, print it in your paperback
Every rap is made in fact to act as a delayed attack
Every phrase a razor blade that’s saved until they play it back
To slay and leave ’em laying on the pavement, bang, fade to black

In the wastelands of today
When there’s nothing left to lose
And there’s nothing more to take
But you force yourself to choose
In the wastelands of today
Where tomorrow disappears
While the future slips away
And your hope turns into fear
In the wastelands of today

Roll credits, you get it, the show is done
They’re talking for just talking, but meaning, they got none
None of ’em come proper, they talk like a shotgun
But how many got bred with integrity? Not one
So no, I’m not afraid to see you suckers hold a blade to me
Ain’t no way to shake the ground I built before you came to be
Take it how you take it, I’m the opposite of vacancy
And this is not negotiation, y’all can hate and wait and see

In the wastelands of today
When there’s nothing left to lose
And there’s nothing more to take
But you force yourself to choose
In the wastelands of today
Where tomorrow disappears
While the future slips away
And your hope turns into fear

1369,Falling In Love With Glaciers,Listener,"I met a shell of a mountain who knew she was finished
Claimed she grew up from a grain of sand
With every year wider she bloomed a little bit longer
To the roof of the sky with outstretched hands
She made friends with the sun, shared enemies with no one
Counted weeks like she should of counted days
And swallowed handfuls of night so she could sleep tight
And turn her thoughts from its stone cold ways

And this was the beginning, the start of the ending
You can’t die from a broken heart
But from the time the sun rose
To the space where it fell away
She would love, and it wouldn’t take part
And every every day she would echo echo
In every single way she should let go let go
But it had her in its sights cupids icy arrows
But so, so what

So she caught every one with her heart like it was her duty
It walked the wrong wrong way down her one way plan
She was surrounded by forests, rivers and beauty
Until that glacier froze over the land
And so she blamed herself hated her wealth
She was born at too young of an age
And every night her dreams were touched by witches fingers
Until her heart was caged.
With every morning spent not caring if she cares or not
Sleeping in the melt and mud, waiting for the earth to rot
Burying herself alive she scrapes the hole that it left open
Empty as her very heart, that mountain was all broken
All broken, that mountain was all broken

Now I can see that her
Her blood’s red and she’s got feelings
And they always get spilled both without thinking
Without thinking, without thinking,
Without thinking, I can see that her

Her blood’s red and she’s got feelings
And they always get spilled both without thinking
Without thinking, they weren’t thinking,
Without thinking, I can see that her

Her blood’s red and she’s got feelings
And they always get spilled both without thinking
Without thinking, I wasn’t thinking,
Without thinking, I can see that our

Our blood’s red and we got feelings
And we always spill both bloods without thinking
Without thinking, what were we thinking,
We weren’t thinking, what were we thinking of

1389,I'm Above,Mad Season,"For clear space and soundess of mind
I’ve let you play me for some time
One can only receive and retain
But the lies you recite for your gain

So you rely on my faith in your kind
Or rather continue to pretend that I’m blind
You say I made your life a living hell
And yet still let me pay you when I fell

How is it you’re feeling so uneasy?
How is it that I feel fine?
Life reveals what is dealt through seasons
Circle comes around each time

I’ve been blessed with eyes to see this
Behind the unwhole truth you hide
Bite to remind the bitten, bigger
Mouth repaying tenfold wide

I’m above
Over you I’m standing above
Claiming unconditional love
Above

Try to keep bad blood in the past
Never thought a chance, a chance it would last
I have strength enough, enough to forgive
I desire peace where I live

I’ve been blessed with eyes to see this
Behind the unwhole truth you hide
Bite to remind the bitten, bigger
Mouth repaying tenfold wide

She was gone and so he wept
Then a demon came to him
""You must know I’m gonna win""

Oh, well, the devil makes us sin
But we like it when we’re spinning in his grip

Love is like a sin, my love
For the ones that feel it the most
Look at her with her eyes like a flame
She will love you like a fly and never love you again

She will love you like a fly and never love you again

1413,Pray For Rain,Massive Attack,"In deepest hollow of our minds
A system failure left behind

And their necks crane
As they turn to pray for rain
And their necks crane

Dull residue of what once was
A shattered cloud of swirling doves

And their eyes change
As they learn to see through flames
And their necks crane
As they turn to pray for rain

Their eyes change
As they learn to see through flames
And their necks crane
As they turn to pray for rain

Drops on rocks fall fast and fleeting
Hearts and wings commence to beating
What’s unseen with all believing
Vision walls fall all receding

Vision walls fall all receding
Drops on rocks come fast and fleeting
Rhythm laws unleash their meaning
Usher us into the dreaming

Vision walls fall all receding
Hearts and wings commence to beating
All unending, all completing
Vision walls fall fast and fleeting

Vision walls fall all revealing
Vision walls fall all revealing
Vision walls fall all revealing
Vision walls fall all revealing

In deepest hollow of our minds
A system failure left behind
Dull residue of what once was
A shattered cloud of swirling doves

And their eyes change

1414,Psyche,Massive Attack,"I’m looking for you in the woods tonight
I’m looking, looking for you with my flashlight
I’m searching from in the high or down the ocean
And I pace myself in racing
Gain the wolf, gain the wolf

Conjure me as a child
Slipping down the wet side
Stretch up, I cannot reach him
Jumping up, they drag him from the water
I watch them march him into life
I watch them take him from the pale
Into the sky for your eagle eye
The sun seeds a sickle and a scythe

Ridicule they won’t allow
Quench abuse and let love flower
Rip the cage out of your chest
Let the chaos fool the rest
Show without showing
What you know without knowing
Twigs snap, I catch, no canoe
Only you and me, alone on the old teal sea

Dissolving who we are
Call out for yesterday’s destiny gone
We’re on a foreign shore
It was the mark of falling
I was the car still running
And when you call I’ll be your shield for life
And if you feel it, you’ll fly
The sunset a-begging me
And I was set to fall in
As I was set to fall in
As I was set to fall in
As I was set to fall in
As I was set to fall in
As I was set to fall in
As I was set to fall in
As I was set to fall in
As I was set to fall in

1415,Rush Minute,Massive Attack,"I wanna be clean but I gotta get high
It’s good to be here, so hard to come by
You bring pain ’cause you got game
And needles and pins a man can’t take

Peaches living in niches
Digging the scene like beautiful cliches
From these shapes of a gangster lean
Ignoring wars on gasoline
Our God’s on yearning and made to get high
God’s left hand wasn’t made to get by
Got more highs left in me
And there’s more room in recovery

From evil states that strip all chrome
From Marshall Amps into broken homes
And borstal blues to countless clicks
That rhythm sticks to those classic cheques
Steal your tears and drown your fears
All is clear in a glass of beer

Peaches living in niches
Digging the scene like beautiful cliches
You fill me with endorphins
And you star in magazines
We draw liquor from the mattress springs
It ain’t over till the last bell rings
Got more highs, you and me
And deluxe rooms in recovery

This town turning, my rose to desire

Saturday come slow, do you love me?
Do you love me? Is there nothing there?

In the limestone caves, in the south ways lands
One time in the kingdom, belief is on the stand

Saturday come slow, do you love me?
Do you love me? Is there nothing there?

Saturday come slow, do you love me?
Do you love me? Do you love me?
Do you love me? Is there nothing there?

1417,Splitting The Atom,Massive Attack,"The baby was born
Nettles and ferns
The evening, it chokes
The candle, it burns
This disguise covers
Bitter lies
Repeating the joke
The meaning, it dies
Pass me a coat
I’m not afraid to leave
I’m letting you know
I know what you need
I’ll turn you around
This beautiful town
And then you’ll believe it
When your eyes then deceive you

It’s easy, dont let it go
It’s easy, dont let it go
It’s easy, dont let it go
Don’t lose it

It’s getting colder outside
Your rented space
They shadow box
And they paper chase
It never stops
And we’ll never learn
No hope without dope
The jobless return
The bankers have bailed
The mighty retreat
The pleasure, it fails
At the end of the week
You take it or leave
Or what you receive
To what you receive
Is eternited leave

It’s easy, dont let it go
It’s easy, dont let it go
It’s easy, dont let it go
Don’t lose it

Incandescent light at doors
In adolescent menopause
In little clicks you got the music stops
The needle sticks and the penny drops
The summer’s gone before you know
The muffled drums of relentless flow
You’re looking at stars that give you vertigo
The sun’s still burning and dust will blow
Honey scars, I’ll keep you near
Our blood is gold, nothing to fear
We killed the time and I love you, dear
A kiss of wine, we’ll disappear
The last of the last particles
Divisible, invisible
The last of the last particles
Divisible, invisible

On the waves that blow wild and free
He splices the ropes and he sets the sail
While southwards he roams to the home of the whale

And he ne’er thinks of me far behind
Or the torments that rage in my mind
He is mine for only part of the year
Then I’m left all alone with only my tears

All ye ladies that smell of wild rose
Thank ye for your perfume of where a man goes
Thank ye all the wives and the babies that yearn
For the man ne’er returned from hunting the sperm

Oh my love he works upon the sea
On the waves that blow wild and free
He splices the ropes and he sets the sail
While southwards he roams to the home of the whale

’Cause it feels like I’ve been
I’ve been here before
You are not my saviour

I could fake it
But I still want more

And the buzz surrounds, it does (buzz surrounds, buzz surrounds)
Closed eyed, sky wide open, unlimited girl, unlimited sigh
Elsewhere, indefinitely far away, magnifies and deepens

Ready to sing, my sixth sense peacefully placed on my breath
And listening (keeps me from my hurt), my ears know that my eyes are closed (perish thoughts like contraband)
I train myself in martial arts as advertised
I reinforce my softened parts as advertised

See through me, little glazed lane a world in myself

Ready to sing, my sixth sense peacefully placed on my breath (flickering I roam)
And listening, my ears know that my eyes are closed
Ready to sing, my sixth sense peacefully placed on my breath (flickering I roam)

On dummy screens and magazines
Closed eyed, sky wide open, unlimited girl, unlimited sigh
To think that I lay next to you wasting time when I could do
A simple job in strip lights, a flask, I drink a sober tea
’Till daylight sends me home flickering I roam

Daydreaming admiring being quietly open the world
I hear the time of the starry sky turning over at midnight

Two undernourished egos, four rotating hips
Hold on to me tightly, I’m a sliding scale
Can’t endure, then you can’t inhale
Clearly, out of body experience interferes
And dreams of flying I fit nearly
Surrounds me though I get lonely

Slowly, moving up slowly, inertia keeps, she’s moving up slowly
Slowly, moving up slowly, inertia creeps, moving up slowly
She comes, moving up slowly, she comes, moving up slowly
Inertia creeps, moving up slowly
She comes, moving up slowly, she comes, moving up slowly

In my home no chrome as clear as
See me now where my nearest tear is
Been there when I’m over careering
Room shifting is endearing
Between us is our kitchen
When she found my irritant’s itchin’
Been here before, been here forever

Moving up slowly, inertia keeps, moving up slowly
Inertia creeps, moving up slowly, inertia keeps, moving up slowly
She comes, moving up slowly, moving up slowly
She comes, moving up slowly, inertia creeps, moving up slowly

I make no sound in my Eiderdown
Awake I lie and the morning’s blue
Room is still, my antenna in you
Nylon burns the bedspread, we’re two
Gravity’s zero, see me stall
I bounce off walls, lose my footing and fall
It can be sweet though incomplete though
And the frames will freeze, see me on all fours
It’s been a long time

She comes, she comes

I want to X you, she comes
I want to X you, she comes
I want to X you

Caught your radio waves
I caught your radio waves, will you take a string?
Say you string me along, say you string me along
Say inertia creeps. Inertia creeps and she comes
Say she comes, say she comes, say she comes, say she comes

Why don’t you close your eyes and reinvent me

You should have let me know
You could have let me know
We’ll go ’till morning comes
And traffic grows, and windows hum
Spending all week with your friends
Give me evenings and weekends
Evenings and weekends

I could be yours, we can unwind
All these outflows, all these outflows

You’d agree it’s a typical high
You fly as you watch your name go by
And once the name goes by
Not thicker than water, nor thicker than mud
And the eight k thuds it does
Sunset so thickly, let’s make it quiet and quickly
Don’t frown, taste better on the way back down

I could be yours, we can unwind
All these outflows, all these outflows
All these outflows will lead to mine

We are vi-vicious, it’s easy now, see
Stick me down, stick me down

We can unwind, all these other flaws
All these other flaws will lead to mine, will see to

It’s how you go down to the men’s room sink
Sad we talk of how madmen think
I seen myself in there upon my lover
I don’t know her from another Miss
I don’t know you from another

See me run now you’re gone, dream on

Why you want to take me to this party and breathe?
I’m dying to leave
Every time we grind you know we severed lines
Where have all those flowers gone, long time passing
Why you keep me testing, keep me tasking?
You keep on asking

Toy-like people make me boy-like
Toy-like people make me boy-like
They’re invisible, when the trip it flips
They get physical, way below my lips
And everything you got’s, hoi polloi like
Now you’re lost, and you’re lethal
And now’s about a time you gotta leave all
these good people, dream on

Nicer than the bird up in the tree-top
Cheaper than the chip inside my laptop
All the variations you could do with me
Nicer than the girl up in your mind you’re free

Automatic crystal remote control
They come to move your soul

You kinda fade into the backgrounds
Like a better smoke’ll bring you back rounds
Like a man slide inside you my dear
Your cheap beer’s filled with crocodile tears
See ’em run now you’re gone, dream on

I'm not a sleep

New intelligence arise in emptied bodies
Turgid flesh tested through eternal spastic
Fits through not known codes mother
Machine in genocide now scorn a dying race

Evolution in reverse now it's time for me
Changing what am I to be contorted
An eternity defeated

Programmed to appease you we're symbols of perfection
Humanoids runed by your laws:
Destroy erase improve lesson first:
Submission we're docile servant dogs
Our leashes are your limbs computed deep within

Remoted minds controlled our thoughts

Another thousands fakes that obey to a circuit skein to vacuum

Mechanical thoughts

Always to see inanity
Millions to be units like me

The nerve fibres give in to cords to the unknown

A systematic denial of the crystalline

To see the fine grain, to read the hidden words
The context of parallel truth
Devoid of fragmentation

Our light-induced image of truth
Filtered blank of its substance
As our eyes won't adhere to intuitive lines
Everything examined, separated, one thing at a time
The harder we stare
The more complete the disintegration
Dissolution

Eyes re-opened
Reasoning focalized
Receptors activated

Perspectives distorted
The ladder beyond our grasp
The twin-headed serpent forever hidden
Where's the true knowledge
Where engines of the sane and insanity merge
The clarity
The unity

Reality untouchable, transparent
Invisible to our fixed, restricted fields of vision
Existence taken for granted

Never stray from the common lines

Ripples ascend to the surface of my eyes
Their red pens drawing at random, at will
A myriad pains begotten in their wake
The bastard spawn of a mutinous self

The regurgitation of my micro nemesis
Salivating red at the prospect of my ruin, my doom

Malfunction - the means for its ascent
Bloodletting - the stringent voice to beckon my soul
So futile, any resisting tension
As death-induced mechanics propel its growth

The implement, the device of my extinction
The terminating clockwork of my gleeful bane
The definitive scourge of its mockery
The end-art instruments lethality attained

Heed - it commands, heed my will
Bleed - it says, bleed you will

Falling into the clarity of undoing
Scornful gods haggle for my soul
Mind's eye flickers and vascillates as I let go
Taunting whispers accompany my deletion

Chanting softly the song of depletion

No unknown weight to tip the knowledge scales
Eyes dilated to grasp it all
As every illusion of what we are fails

An unquestionable picture - determined, complete
Its crystalline lines untouched by doubt
So vivid, so deprived of hesitation
Shining in its evil splendor

The burning hatred of man
A million degrees on display
Human voracity delineated
The demons in us all by fumes portrayed

Stare, see, take in, grasp
Comprehend, assimilate, behold your reflection

The framing - gold plated lies
The canvas - hurting souls caught and weaved
The artist - the human dream
Incinerated, devoured, deceived

Growing darkness taking dawn

For a hill, men would kill, why? They do not know
Stiffened wounds test their pride
Men of five, still alive through the raging glow
Gone insane from the pain that they surely know

For whom the bell tolls
Time marches on
For whom the bell tolls

Take a look to the sky just before you die
It’s the last time he will
Blackened roar, massive roar, fills the crumbling sky
Shattered goal fills his soul with a ruthless cry
Stranger now, are his eyes, to this mystery
He hears the silence so loud
Crack of dawn, all is gone except the will to be
Now they see, what will be, blinded eyes to see

A small mouse peeked out from a hole beneath the stairs
nearby to where my dad sat in his favorite chair,
Thinking about the gov’t and muttering a prayer
I scattered some oats in hopes she’d stay
And sat still to stop from scaring her away-
But she hurried on her little way
And scurried around my mind
Ever since,
Every day

Open wide my door, my door, my Lord
(Open wide my door)
To whatever makes me love You more
(Open wide my door)
While there’s still light to run towards
(Open wide my door)

Like water on dry wood
Equal parts misguided and misunderstood
But all the neighborhood
Watched a fire burn from where they stood
And the smoke said
""We’re not half as bad as G-d is good""
And there’s a whisper in my ear,
The voice of loneliness and fear, so I say:

""Devil, disappear!
I’m still (ehh… technically…) a virgin
After 27 years-
Which never bothered me before,
What’s maybe 50 more?""

Open wide my door, my door, my Lord
(Open wide my door)
To whatever makes me love You more
(Open wide my door)
While there’s still light to run towards
(Open wide my door)

She came back for the oats
But she brought along a ""friend""

The lower the flowers in the garden bend

Than to continue to pretend

As my ear pressed against the past like a glass on a wall of a house in a photograph.
My forehead no longer sweet with holy kisses worthy of your fiery lips.

You watch me like a ten car highway wreck with detached, vulgar curiosity.
This looking down at the tops of the hats of us passers-by from your 7th floor balcony.
From such a height you missed creatures too small for sight carry on covert conversations.
And the misguided insects crown me their grasshopper king with a dance of celebration.

After years with a crown on my head, I’ve grown overfed, unconcerned and comfortably numb.
Kept busy indulging in the pleasures of the wealthy.
(Someone make me afraid of what I’ve become!)
At the first sign of possible sorrow, I turned my heels and ran.
(Oh, I’ll never learn.)
My life is a cup of sugar I’ve borrowed before time began and forgot to return.

It was a matter of time--I always said I could see so now I’m going blind. (I could be your servant)

1461,Should Have Known Better,Ministry,"So many years I just suffered through the tears
Knowing one day I’d wake up wishing I had never met her
But as the time goes by my hope keeping playing every day
As I laugh to myself, ""I just should have known better""

There’s no more laughter as I think about the other girl
It’s a slap in my face as I’m opening her letter
She’s doing fine now with two kids and another man
As I cry out loud, ""I just should have known better""

She was the reason I was living every day
I would ride upon a white horse in my quest to try and find her
But now it’s too late, I don’t care if I die tonight
’cause a voice keeps ringing in my heart, ""I should have known better""

I learned my lesson this time
Loneliness and a broken heart
Should’ve known right from the start

I learned my lesson this time
Loneliness and a broken heart
Should’ve known right from the start

Extreme ways that help me, that help me out late at night
Extreme places I had gone, but never seen any light
Dirty basements, dirty noise, dirty places coming through
Extreme worlds alone, did you ever like it then?

I would stand in line for this
There’s always room in life for this

Extreme sounds that told me, they helped me down every night
I didn’t have much to say, I didn’t give up the light
I closed my eyes and closed myself and closed my world and never opened
Up to anything that could get me along

I had to close down everything, I had to close down my mind
Too many things that caught me, too much can make you blind
I’ve seen so much in so many places, so many heartaches, so many faces
So many dirty things, you couldn’t even believe

You know what they say…

Some things in life are bad
They can really make you mad
Other things just make you swear and curse
When you’re chewing on life’s gristle
Don’t grumble, give a whistle
And this’ll help things turn out for the best

And always look on the bright side of life
Always look on the light side of life

If life seems jolly rotten
There’s something you’ve forgotten
And that’s to laugh and smile and dance and sing
When you’re feeling in the dumps
Don’t be silly chumps
Just purse your lips and whistle, that’s the thing

And always look on the bright side of life
Come on!
Always look on the right side of life

For life is quite absurd
And death’s the final word
You must always face the curtain with a bow
Forget about your sin
Give the audience a grin
Enjoy it, it’s your last chance anyhow

So, always look on the bright side of death
A-just before you draw your terminal breath

Life’s a piece of shit
When you look at it
Life’s a laugh and death’s a joke, it’s true
You’ll see it’s all a show
Keep ’em laughing as you go
Just remember that the last laugh is on you

And always look on the bright side of life
Always look on the right side of life

C’mon Brian, cheer up!

Always look on the bright side of life
Always look on the bright side of life

Worse things happen at sea, you know
Always look on the bright side of life

I mean, what have you got to lose
You know, you come from nothing, you’re going back to nothing
What have you lost? Nothing!

Always look on the right side of life…

Nothing will come from nothing, you know what they say?
Cheer up you old bugger, c’mon give us a grin!

Left with a heart exhausted
What’s my release?

Tear meat from the bone

1481,Your God Is Dead,Mussolini Headkick,"This ain’t faith — this is napalm
This ain’t hope — this is blackmail
No holy love — just holy pressure

Truth wrapped in lies — sick and contorted
This ain’t good — this ain’t freedom
This ain’t faith — this is religion

This is religion

Your head held high, your heart so proud
Too blind to see the evil in you
Once a week you flock like fools

Leading the blind through empty salvation

1485,Before I Get Old,New Model Army,"I’m going to kiss the girls, make them cry
Live too fast, still not die - before I get old
I’m going to see you raised above this place
Watch the moments shine upon your face
Before I get old
I’ll watch the sun set over every sea
From every city wall, every mountain peak
Before I get old
The Northern Lights and the Southern Cross
The harvests and the miles of dust
And the blowing wind across the world
So wrap this coat around yourself
And leave what’s done behind
There’s so much left for us to do
And yet there’s so little time
I’m going to pull the fences to the ground
Watch the twisted towers come crumbling down
And start again
I want to be a hero and a villain and a father and a son
Take care of my body and abuse it still
Until everything goes numb
So let’s make this dance and never fear
That there’s any real reason why we’re all here
Live real fast, still not die
Before I get old

The world is big enough for both of us
The pack’s been shuffled now - we’ve got different hands
There’s different enemies for both of us now
There’s no one round here who remembers those times
When we were little kings of our own different sides
Was I the punk who stole your thunder
Or was it all just the other way round?

Ch: Now it’s gone, done, the feud is over
Funny how vendettas just turn into a bore
Gone, done, the feud is over
I really can’t be bothered anymore

Bury the hatchet with a smile and a curse
The world is big enough for both of us
But oh how that bitching was fun while it lasted
Until I got to realise no one really cared

Ch: Now it’s gone, done, the feud is over
Funny how vendettas just turn into a bore
Gone, done, the feud is over
I really can’t be bothered anymore

It’s such a waste of my time, thinking of you
And all the stuff that I hear which may or may not be true
I never did like you, probably never will
But I bet you can live with that fact pretty well
People get to drinking, they get sentimental
Maybe I’m a bastard human after all
Bury the hatchet with a smile and a curse

And this whole thing is just ridiculous

Just to put your makeup on
The wardrobe’s full of useless clothes
Your winter coats are gone
The jackal pack is feeding
The motorway sweeps down
The council tries to bribe the rich
Just to stay in town

Get me out
Get me out of this place
Get me out of this trap
Get me out of my brain

Ysidro down to Melbourne
The pressure starts to build
The bullets fly at random
When you least expect they will
Everybody feels guilty
So anyone can pay
I’m just surprised it doesn’t happen every bloody day

Get me out
Get me out of this place
Get me out of this trap
Get me out of my brain

So here come the nineties
The temperature is rising
I cannot seem to lose the stains
When I wash my hands
One world is rising
One world is dying
And one has got its precious head
Buried in the sand

Get me out
Get me out of this place
Get me out of this trap

You scream and we’re gone - falling out

There must have been times in the smoke and the beat on the dance-floor
When all of the doors, they were opening for you
There must have been times when you thought you were kings of the whole world
With the chemicals eating away at your reason
But now you’re shut down, closed in
We build our own little jails
I’ve had to watch this thing so many times
Another little death of innocence

Now, we scream, you run - fall out
You scream and we’re gone - falling out

None of us saw the clever image you hold of yourselves
The things that you thought were so cool were just a joke to everyone else
Didn’t they tell you when you pulled a stupid expression
That when the wind changed you’d be stuck with it forever?
And now you’re shut down, closed in, with all the money you owe
I’ve had to watch this thing so many times
Another little death of innocence

We scream, you run - fall out
You scream and we’re gone - falling out

1489,Lurhstaap,New Model Army,"One swallow never made a spring
You can buy a crown - it doesn’t make you king
Beware the trinkets that we bring

When the visionary dreams set hard and grey as flesh made into stone
You tore the statues to the ground crying - let my people go
And now they’re gone, all is gone
But these changing winds can turn cold and hostile

The freedom passion and the two faced call
They dance together upon the wall
With nothing left to break the fall

Now twenty-five miles north in the great dark woods
The college buildings stand
And the ghosts of hope walk silent halls at the death of the Promised Land
All is gone, all is gone
But these changing winds can turn cold and hostile

And in the shadows of the crowded square, a thousand paper deals go down
And hungry sharks from everywhere smell the blood and head for town
Innocence starts to peel away - How money changes everything
The past it eats the future up and this blind desire eats everything

Now the rats they leave one stricken ship for another sailing past
Your world was going nowhere slow while ours goes nowhere fast
And now it’s gone, all is gone
But these changing winds can blow cold and hostile

1490,Lust For Power,New Model Army,"Across the flatlands we came out of nowhere special
Like a peasant revolution - makeshift weapons in our hands
We crashed the gates so hard we’d never heard that kind of sound before
And braced ourselves for victory and the spoils of the land
Defences melt away before our frozen blank surprise
From the palace now we stare into a million waiting eyes
Ch: I’ve got my trophies on the wall, the heads I’ve hunted down the hall
And I guard my winnings well, carry them with me when I fall
Now the daylight hours pass like the people I have lost
In the triumph of the hour, in the bloody cause - lust for power

Like a vision she dances through the shafts of light
Everything I’ve ever dreamed about focused true and bright
And fortune opens up the ground, blackens out the sky
I kissed her once, I kissed her twice but I couldn’t remember why
When I was young they taught me well to always play to win
But they never said what happens when you’ve won the bloody game
Ch: I’ve got my trophies on the wall…

And all desire is satisfied but still the hunt goes on
It’s funny how this feeling stays with all the reasons gone

We’ve seen them fat and bloated those who once could hold a flame
I’ve run for home and words gone by but nothing seems the same
I can watch the world in secrecy from one side of this glass
From the other my reflection and I don’t know which is worse
The streets are lined with glittering stores and a million fatted calves
I can catch myself sometimes these days and all I do is laugh, laugh
Ch: I’ve got my trophies on the wall…

1491,Purity,New Model Army,"The rains move in eastwards, in waves of succession
Drawing lines of grey across the sky
With history just as close as a hand on the shoulder
In hunger and impatience we cry

The battle against corruption rages in each corner
There must be something better, something pure
And the call it is answered from the caves to the cities
Come the dealers of salvation on Earth

We’ve seen the restless children at the head of the columns
Come to purify the future with the arrogance of youth
Nothing is as cruel as the righteousness of innocence
With automatic weapons and a gospel of the truth

Revolution forever, succession of the seasons
Within the blood of nature, all raised to rot and die
This purity is a lie

Now immaculate conception in sterilised laboratories
How the vanity goes on
Or in the message of the preacher with his morals and obsessions
The wars that we wage upon ourselves

Purity is a virtue, purity is an angel
Purity is for madmen to make fools of us all
So forgive yourself my friend, all this will soon be over
What happened here tonight is nothing at all

Revolution forever, succession of the seasons
Within the blood of nature, all raised to rot and die
This purity is a lie

I will always see Brendan at that broken down piano
His fingers thick and red, shaking on the keys
Battered by the years of alcohol and working
Still playing with the faith that never leaves

So sit us down, buy us a drink, tell us a good story
Sing us a song we know to be true
I don’t give a damn that I never will be worthy
Fear is the only enemy that I still know

1492,Space,New Model Army,"You walk the thinnest of the ice, so easy to hurt
We drove through the dark in the pouring rain and barely said a word
So dress your wounds as best you can and close your tired eyes
Try to climb away from here towards the empty skies

And I’ll meet you there, high above it all
In the kiss of air, the lover’s breath
Visions rise from each little death

As Moses stands and turns his gaze away from the feuding tribes
Walks towards the mountains and through the rocks he climbs
God, he orders Moses, ""Bring the people to my will""
""Leave me be,"" cries Moses, keeps on walking up the hill

And I’ll meet you there, high above it all
In the kiss of air, the lover’s breath
Visions rise from each little death

And should the Devil come and should he say
""All of this will I give to you, if you just bow down and worship me""
I’m on my knees

""The white twisted clouds and the endless shades of blue in the ocean make the hum of the spacecraft systems, the radio chatter, even your own breathing disappear. There is no cold or wind or smell to tell you that you are connected to Earth. You have an almost dispassionate platform - remote, Olympian and yet so moving that you can hardly believe how emotionally attached you are to those rough patterns shifting steadily below.""

If you really want to take the time
But don’t expect to get answers to anything, Eddie
There is just one thing I’ve learned
Through everything that I’ve done and tried
Everything I have justified
It’s all vanity, all vanity - we try to have control
It’s all vanity, all vanity ’cause Chaos rules it all

I always drive like a madman, Eddie
But you’ll soon get used to that
I believe if you’re moving fast enough, Eddie
You don’t ever have to watch your back
I choose solid ground to make my stands
I stay off the streets at closing time
It’s all vanity, all vanity - we try to have control
It’s all vanity, all vanity ’cause Chaos rules it all

Remember how it was out at Bunglass
We climbed up to the peak and stood against the rocks
The photographs came - you couldn’t see us
We were lost against the mountains like specks of dust
And the mirror never lies, it’s just these foolish eyes
And we all see what we want to see
What we need to see, what we have to see
And so will you do just the same one day, Eddie
I’ve been to that place a thousand times
Looked over the edge so many times
Wanted to jump a thousand times

Well we talk about saving the world now, Eddie
It’s our vanity gone mad
She’ll survive us all perfectly well
When we’re all long buried and dead
Clever monkeys with technology
Barely out of the caves and the trees
It’s all vanity, all vanity - we try to have control
It’s all vanity, all vanity ’cause Chaos rules it all
Eddie now let it go…
I turn my head away from here
Down towards the rolling seas again
I kneel and worship where I can
The ground comes swirling up and through these veins…

1494,Whirlwind,New Model Army,"I felt a shiver in the heat-haze and the waiting time is over
Strange tongues on the airwaves as the voices call from distant lands
I saw which was the winning side but still I joined the other
And I’m in love with every strange unfolding day
As the storm begins to break cover
So let the whirlwind blow
- through the ice, the melting snows
- across the freezing skies and the tiny lights below

And so we shutter up the doorways as the ripples move towards us
For a moment stop breathing - She wakes and stirs beneath our feet
The Order try to stand their ground, while every battlefront is shifting
They still believe that they can hold the reins
But then they’ve got no sense of history
So let the whirlwind blow
- through the ice, the melting snows
- across the freezing skies and the tiny lights below
- the waters seething, bubbling out of control
- come on take my hand and we’ll dive

A television blares in an empty room
The poisoned waters glisten
Goliath staggers round in a punch-drunk daze
Doesn’t understand what hit him
I saw which was the winning side but still I joined the other
And I’m in love with every strange unfolding day
As the storm begins to break cover
Let the whirlwind blow

Just like a candle blown out in the wind
Just like a bird that can no longer float
I’m feeling that way sometimes
But then as I’m falling weighed down by the load
I picture a light at the end of the road
and closing my eyes I can see through the dark
the dream that is in my heart

A little loving, a little giving
to build a dream for the world we live in
a little patience and understanding
for our tomorrow, a little peace
a little sunshine, a sea of gladness
to wash away all the tears of sadness
a little hoping, a little praying
for our tomorrow, a little peace

I feel I’m a leaf in the November snow
I fell to the ground, there was no one below
So now I am helpless alone with my song
just wishing the storm was gone

A little loving, a little giving
to build a dream for the world we live in
a little patience and understanding
for our tomorrow, a little peace
a little sunshine, a sea of gladness
to wash away all the tears of sadness
a little hoping, a little praying
for our tomorrow, a little peace

And I held it for a moment

In a dream I saw it flying
to a far and distant shore
Where the people stood
and watched it with a smile

Soon the quarreling was over
There was peace throughout the land
Making all the days of traveling
seem worthwhile

There were tulip fields in Holland
And the roses in Versailles
And the English country garden
in the sun

Edelweiss and bright red poppies
Lovely blue forget-me-nots
Growing tall and proud,
and shared by everyone

Were a part of my wonderland
And we'll always be friends

Where have all my heroes gone
Precious friends that were dear to me
From the kingdom of fantasy
They just faded away

Where have all my heroes gone
Cinderella and Peter Pan
All the stories of fairyland
Have they come to an end?

Good ol' Kermit and Superman
Were a part of my wonderland
And we'll always be friends
And we'll always be friends
And we'll always be friends

1500,Don’t Fly Too High,Nicole,"He was old and he walked slowly through the park
To the bench where he would sleep on after dark
He saw a bird high on a tree
And said listen carefully
So your life will not end in misery

Don't fly too high, my little bird
'Cause if you try you may get hurt
You will burn your wings
When you reach for the sun
Don't fly too high, my little bird
Your lonely cry won't be heard
You'll be tumbling down to the ground
'Cause pride will have a fall

Then the little bird came flying from the tree
And it landed lightly on the old man's knee
Just a tiny piece of bread, 'twas all the old man had
But he gave it to the little bird and said

Don't fly too high, my little bird
'Cause if you try you may get hurt
You will burn your wings
When you reach for the sun
Don't fly too high, my little bird
Your lonely cry won't be heard
You'll be tumbling down to the ground
'Cause pride will have a fall

Then one morning the old man went to the highway
All the cars he tried to stop were passing by
So he could not save his friend
Who was dying in his hands
Because his broken wings would never mend
Don't fly too high, my little bird
'Cause if you try you may get hurt
You will burn your wings
When you reach for the sun
Don't fly too high, my little bird
Your lonely cry won't be heard
You'll be tumbling down to the ground
'Cause pride will have a fall

1502,The Poet And The Pendulum,Nightwish,"I. ""WHITE LANDS OF EMPATHICA""

The end.

The songwriter’s dead.
The blade fell upon him
Taking him to the white lands
Of Empathica
Of Innocence
Empathica
Innocence

II. ""HOME""

The dreamer and the wine
Poet without a rhyme
A widowed writer torn apart by chains of hell

One last perfect verse
Is still the same old song
Oh Christ how I hate what I have become

Take me home

Getaway, runaway, fly away
Lead me astray to dreamer’s hideaway
I cannot cry ’cause the shoulder cries more
I cannot die, I, a whore for the cold world
Forgive me
I have but two faces
One for the world
One for God
Save me
I cannot cry ’cause the shoulder cries more
I cannot die, I, a whore for the cold world

My home was there ’n then
Those meadows of heaven
Adventure-filled days
One with every smiling face

Please, no more words
Thoughts from a severed head
No more praise
Tell me once my heart goes right

Take me home

Getaway, runaway, fly away
Lead me astray to dreamer’s hideaway
I cannot cry ’cause the shoulder cries more
I cannot die, I, a whore for the cold world
Forgive me
I have but two faces
One for the world
One for God
Save me
I cannot cry ’cause the shoulder cries more
I cannot die, I, a whore for the cold world
Whore for the cold world
Whore for the cold world

III. ""THE PACIFIC""

Sparkle my scenery
With turquoise waterfall
With beauty underneath
The Ever Free

Tuck me in beneath the blue
Beneath the pain, beneath the rain
Goodnight kiss for a child in time
Swaying blade my lullaby

On the shore we sat and hoped
Under the same pale moon
Whose guiding light chose you
Chose you all

""I’m afraid, so afraid.
Being raped again, and again, and again
I know I will die alone.
But loved.

You live long enough to hear the sound of guns,
long enough to find yourself screaming every night,
long enough to see your friends betray you.

For years I’ve been strapped unto this altar.
Now I only have three minutes and counting.
I just wish the tide would catch me first and give me a death I always longed for.""

IV. ""DARK PASSION PLAY""

Second robber to the right of Christ
Cut in half - infanticide
The world will rejoice today
As the crows feast on the rotting poet

Everyone must bury their own
No pack to bury the heart of stone
Now he’s home in hell, serves him well
Slain by the bell, tolling for his farewell

The morning dawned, upon his altar
Remains of the dark passion play
Performed by his friends without shame
Spitting on his grave as they came

Getaway, runaway, fly away
Lead me astray to dreamer’s hideaway
I cannot cry ’cause the shoulder cries more
I cannot die, I, a whore for the cold world
Forgive me
I have but two faces
One for the world
One for God
Save me
I cannot cry ’cause the shoulder cries more
I cannot die, I, a whore for the cold world
Whore for the cold world
Whore for the cold world

""Today, in the year of our Lord 2005,
Tuomas was called from the cares of the world.
He stopped crying at the end of each beautiful day.
The music he wrote had too long been without silence.

He was found naked and dead,
With a smile in his face, a pen and one thousand pages of erased text.""

Save me

V. ""MOTHER & FATHER""

Be still, my son
You’re home
Oh when did you become so cold?
The blade will keep on descending
All you need is to feel my love

Search for beauty, find your shore
Try to save them all, bleed no more
You have such oceans within
In the end
I will always love you

The beginning.

underneath the floor and so far out of reach,

Against this shelter they are always hammering.
Against these ears they are always deafening.

Our pain is always,
accurate and striving to evade,
its only design.
It wants to strike you down,
to fall into its arms again.
Blood is thicker than water,
but which one did you drink?

What I know was divided and broken down,
by the ignorance of others.
Spoken from their lips,
but with the lungs of another.
Sounds great,
but tastes like blood.

These rumor sessions are assembled by us all… by us all.
They are the earth and we are the breath of life.

Your pain is always,
accurate and striving to evade,

Scratching into any surface it wants
Joy and beauty rejected so many times
A world of hurt, a heart of false hope

And while we thought that we were learning how to live
We have been learning how to die
I should have known, we will be legends

Our hopes and dreams, our worst nightmares
Our worst nightmares have now come true
Tonight when this deep sleep falls on men
Driven by an instinct more powerful than life itself
From horror to hope, from hope and devastation

And while we thought that we were learning how to live
We have been learning how to die
I should have known, we will be legends

Overfed and unconcerned
It came with teeth and claw
Oh, hated form of emotion

Don’t break my fall
(Cause things look better from down here)
To lose it all
(Just means there’s another chance for you to)
Gain it back again
And maybe even have a laugh, my friend

What can I hide?
When every feeling’s locked down deep inside
My hands are tied
But I’m hangin’ on
And I’m hangin’ in

Don’t break my fall
(Cause things look better from down here)
To lose it all
(Just means there’s another chance for you to)
Gain it back again
And maybe even have a laugh, my friend

Sure do like the sound of it

1540,Fountain & Vine,Oleander,"Open your shelters and let us all in
Tired and homeless are hungry again
Outside my window at fountain and vine
Drunks and the addicts are forming a line

Sharing their stories to comfort dispair
Carry the weight of the crosses they bear
Praying for courage and wisdom to change
Serenity costs more than pocket book change

I want to tear down the walls
And shatter the image that falls
I want to turn all the tables
And give back what doesn’t belong to me, yeah

Sleeping on sidewalks is how people live
Begging for something no one wants to give
Size of your wealth is a bottle of wine
Sipped with your friends you’ll soon leave behind

Are your children in flames,
Incarcerated and bound by the chain?
Strangers paralyze
Down in the gutters of fountain and vine

I want to tear down the walls
And shatter the image that falls
I want to turn all the tables
And give back what doesn’t belong to me, yeah

Feel like running away, like running away
Tired of seeing them falling aside
There’s no running away
I’m running, I’m running away

I want to tear it all down
Build it all up from the ground
I want to tear down the walls
And shatter the image that falls on me

The view from down here
Brings mention to mind
Everything’s sacred on fountain and vine

Like your hands are off the wheel?
Don’t it tear you down, don’t it turn your world around,
Don’t it love to let you down?

Don’t, don’t it make your day
To gather up your strength
And feel it slipping away?

Before you fall apart,
Before you start to break?

It's a lesson that you learn in time.
It's a worry that you feel,
Another scar that you conceal from sight.

Have I been away too long
For me to say?
Have I been away too long
For things to change?

From a runaway train.
Caught beneath the wheels
Of a runaway train.

Every moment of the day
I feel it crumbling away, if I…
I only have myself to blame
For all the cracks within the frame that I find.

Have I been away too long
For me to say?

Lurking in the core of us all
The last dying call for the everlost
Brief encounters, bleeding pain

Lepers coiled neath the trees
Dying men in bewildered soliloquies
Perversions bloom round the bend
Seekers, lost in their quest
Ghosts of friends frolic
Under the waning moon

It is the year of death
Wielding his instruments
Stealth sovereign reaper
Touching us with ease

Infecting the roots in an instant
Burning crop of disease
I am just a spectator
An advocate documenting the loss
Fluttering with conceit
This doesn’t concern me yet
Still far from the knell
Taunting their bereavement

Mob round the dead
Point fingers at the details
Probing vomits for more
Caught in unbridled suspense

We have all lost it now
Catching the flakes of dismay
Born the travesty of man
Regular pulse midst pandemonium
You’re plucked to the mass
Parched with thirst for the wicked

Sick liaisons raised this monumental mark
The sun sets forever over Blackwater park

Nightmares of the sun

I am dying fast inside your tears

Plunging towards
Bereavement
Faster yet
Clearing thoughts

Is set

Devious movements in your eyes
Moved me from relief
Breath comes out white clouds with your lies
And filters through me

You’re close to the final word
You’re staring right past me in dismay
A liquid seeps from your chest
And drains me away

Mist ripples round your thin white neck
And draws me a line
Cold fingers mark this dying wreck
This moment is mine

Help me
Cure you
Atone for all you’ve done
Help me
Leave you
As all the days are gone

Mourners lament, but it’s me who’s the martyr

Pledge yourself to me
Never leave me be

Into the orchard I walk peering way past the gate
Wilted scenes for us who couldn’t wait

Embers neath my skin
Veiled in pale embrace
Reached and touched my face

Brings night into all you say

I’m counting nocturnal hours
Drowned visions in haunted sleep
Faint flickering of your powers
Leaks out to show what you keep

Pull me down again and guide me into…

There is failure inside
This test I can’t persist
Kept back by the enigma
No criterias demanded here
Deadly patterns made my wreath
Prosperous in your ways
Pale ghost in the corner
Pouring a caress on your shoulder

Ooh, puzzled by shrewd innocence
Runs a thick tide beneath
Ushered into inner graves
Nails bleeding from the struggle

It’s the end for the weak at heart
Always the same
A lullaby for the ones who’ve lost all
Reeling inside
Gleaming eye in your necklace reflects
Stare of primal regrets
You turn your back and you walk away
Never again

Spiraling to the ground below
Like autumn leaves left in the wake to fade
Waking up to your sound again
And lapse into the ways of misery

Morning’s breath on the sill
Idle hands given another try

Ruby eyes in the fog

Rain washing clean all the sins
A liquid gown that covers all
Your loathe turns endless
Opened mirage soothes your sense
Locked on the pinnacle
The best secret within

Like a derelict child
Heart burning for a stranger
Ascending to the meek
Flock round the liars in awe

Caked in the soil beneath
Fear me when we meet
Turn away in admiration
My firm grip round the nucleus of joy

Enough of this
You will leave me now
You will see it now
Perish at my hands

Close to you
Tangled up in hair
Fresh stigma look
Shall I take you with me
And it is cold
Ruby eyes in the fog
It is me

And you are just like them all
Stained by the names of fathers
I’m greeting my downward fall
Leaving the throes to others

Neath the lid all limbs tucked away

Your body is mine to avail
Such a tragic sight you are
Slave under my creed
Spurring me with those tears

I am beyond death
Midst a dreaming affinity
Saving strength now, faint whispers
Come erotic communion in its splendour

Fever mirrored ghosts
Night time consolation, cross the line
Draw murder into art
Sleep inside through days

In the wake of this relief
Shivering, longing for more
Insanity at its peak
Love me to my death

Lost are days of Spring
You sighted and let me in
Keep the beast inside
Shackled within my hide
Screaming out too late
Losing to my hate
Grew together with your skin
And paced the trails of sin

Your gaze covered in virgin snow
Rigid features
It’s the shallow deeds who is to blame
Deafening shrieks pierced the night

A step from oblivion
Moving into the dim lights
Hiding within a reverie
It was worth it for the wait alone

Your body is mine to avail
Such a tragic sight you are
Slave under my creed
Spurring me with those tears

Prayers a hope lives on

There is a road I’m always walking

You’ll never return to this place

Gone through days
Without talking
There is a comfort
In silence
So used to losing
All ambition
Struggling to maintain what’s left

Should contemplate this change
To ease the pain
And I
Should step out of the rain

To ease the pain
And I
Should step out of the rain

Slurred voice over children cries
On
The inside

Haunting loneliness in the eye

Let loose you hair
We’re intertwined forever and have always been

And I’ll depart
Upon your lips dwells nothing but the meaning of my cause

Vibrant as ever before
Flowers already withered
In this endless winter of souls

Outside in the park
The days move along
And nothing ever changes
They have nothing on us
And we’ve always knew
That nothing ever changes

Unwinding snares of distrust

From love to death
In a time span of seconds
Oblivious to regret
Pushed into belief
In liquid cellophane
Gasping for air
Mercy in my eyes
Is the shade of the night

The piercing sounds you make
Soaring higher, higher now
And once left in my wake
Your memory is nothing but the scars on me

Standing down
Disappear into the obscure
Resting days
Waiting for new disease
Biding time
Looked inside insanity

It always burns within
The downward spiral never ends
When driven into sin

Distorted faith in myself
Human harvest burning
Blackest pages turning
Twisted perception come true
Captured in dreams connected

You’d cling to your pleasant hope
It is twisted fascination
While I’d ruin the obstacles into despair

In a holocaust scene memory

Decrepit body wearing transparent skin
Inside, the smoke of failure

Wept for solace and submit to faith
In his shadow I’m choking
Yet flourishing

I sacrificed more than I had
And left my woes beneath the mire

Pouring venom, brew deceiving

Devil cracked the earthly shell

Dedicated hunter

Mother light received
A faithful servant’s free

Faded out her voice and soiled her name
Like torn-out pages in a diary
Everything seemed clean that is unstained
Incoherent talk of ordinary days

Decide what’s clear and what’s within a haze
What you should take and what to give

Saint’s premonition’s unclear
Keeper of holy hordes
Keeper of holy whores, uhh!

In despair of what’s to come

If one cut the source of the flow

In the shadow of the righteous?

Where the victim is the prey

1566,The Baying of the Hounds,Opeth,"I hear the baying of the hounds
In the distance. I hear them devouring
Pest-ridden jackals of the earth
Diabolical beasts and roaming the forests
In wait and constant protectors
Calling you to sit by his side
Your self-loathing image in his flesh
A revelation upon which you linger

His words are flies
Swarming towards the true insects
Feasting on buried dreams
And spreading decay upon your skin
His eyes spew forth a darkness
That cut through and paralyze
Casts light upon your secrets
Forced to confront your enemies

His mouth is a vortex
Sucking you into its pandemonium
Fools you with a helping hand of ashes
Reached out in false dismay
His body is a country
The cities lay dead beyond despair
Friends turned enemies unable to come clean
In a rising fog of reeking death

Everything you believed is a lie
Everyone you loved is a death-burden
So you take comfort in him
And you are receptive to stark wishes
No longer struggling to declare your stand
You would inflict no harm to others
They are unaware and in a loop of futile events
You are everything, they are nothing

Drown in the deep mire
With past desires
Beneath the mire
Drown desire now with you

Lined up verses on dead skin
The tainted lips of a stranger
Resting upon hers

And I embrace bereavement
Everything beloved is shattered anyway
I would devote myself to anyone
I would accept any flaws

I am too weak to resist
Tension vibrating with horror
Finding the outcast in my eyes
Pushing nerves on a puppet
Endless poison in my veins
Clean intent now tainted with death

And so, cold touch now inhumane
Every waking hour
Awaiting a reverie to unfold
Louder by the minute
The baying of the hounds
Calling me back to my home

Of Satan
Assembling
His flock
Pale horse
Rider
Searching
The earth

Whispered conjuration, a belief takes form
Choking hand tapping the veins in your throat
His orders in your mouth, a decree for domination
Beneath the tides of wisdom, spins the undertow of hate
Injected seeds of vengeance, usurper’s eyes of the powerless
Clean path to his kingdom beckoning in the mist

The grand conjuration

Tell me why
Love subsides
In the light
Of your wish
Say my name
Ease the pain
Clear the smoke
In my head

1568,Advent,Opeth,"It was all true
A parlour strode, and the night sets forever
I stray in the quiet cold
And you gird me when I dare to listen

Elastic meadow, endless arms of sorrow
Lips try to form ""because""
Trying to adapt to the wilderness
Where even foes close their eyes and leave

We are inside the glade
Every now and then I wipe the dust aside
To remember…

How I drape my face with my bare hands
The same that brought me here
But you were beyond all help
The folded message that wept my name

Shadows skulk at my coming
We survey the slopes
In search for the words to write the missing page
The tainted dogma

Time grows short
As the piper plays his tune
We are almost there

You are beyond all help
Dancing into the void
We are almost there

1569,Black Rose Immortal,Opeth,"In the name of desperation
I call your name
A lamentation I sigh
Again and again

Spiritual eclipse
The gateways are closed for me to seek

The night…
A veil of stars, watching
My shadow is born from light
The light of the eye, in darkness

Over troubled waters memories soar
Endlessly, searching night and day
The moonlight caresses a lonely hill
With the calmness of a whisper

I wear a naked soul
A blank face in the streaming water
It is cold in here
Frost scar my coat with dust

Eyes attach to your mute portrait
We spoke only through thoughts
Together we gazed, awaited
Hours brought thirst and the rising sun

Sunbirds leave their dark recesses
Shadows glid the archways

Do not turn your face towards me
Confronting me with my lonliness
You are in a forest unknown
The secret orchard
And your voice is vast and achromatic
But still so precious

Lullaby of the crescent moon took you
Mesmerized, its kaleidoscopic face
Granted you a hollow stare
Another soul within the divine herd

I have kept it
The amaranth symbol
Hidden inside the golden shrine
Until we rejoice in the meadow
Of the end
When we both walk the shadows
It will set ablaze and vanish
Black rose immortal

It is getting dark again
Dusk shuffle across the fields
The evening trees moan as if they knew
At night I always dream of you

1570,Eternal Soul Torture,Opeth,"The deceased awake from beyond their sleep.
Search for blood and mortal meat.
Maggots crawl out from their eyes.
Feel their pain, it’s mournful cries.
Pull your veins, tear out your heart.
Consume the blood, feast on flesh.
Torn apart, intestines scattered.
Alimentary canal ripped and shattered.
Pieces of your body eaten.
Painful death as time stands still.
Where your mind bursts in torture.
Feel your soul be torn apart.
Demons crawling through your system.
Hell has risen, the gods of pain.
Rip your skin, burn your bones.
Internal organs torn and drained.
Smell of flesh burnt to ashes.
Cries of death from hell.
Pain is all you revolve around.
Where the souls of Satan’s grounds.
Rooms of eternal torture, reveal endurance of endless pain.
Disintegrating mortals, bodies burn.
There you feel the hellish torture.
Hellish torment, brutal butchering.
Demonic creatures revolve in torment…

1571,Nectar,Opeth,"I arose from the lullaby
Enduring yet another tale
You tempt me again
With your embrace, so tainted
Within the night you beckon
Cursing me with every glance

Bring me through
Carry my empty shadow
And guide me inside your warped labyrinth
To the well of sin
I swear I will always love you

Leave me speechless
Release my yearning
The soil I walk is clad with light
Drifting moons thrust me with their rays
And I fall inside

I lament this heritage
Cannot bid farewell
The pale face… you went as far as you could
And from that moment
I witnessed your beauty, fealt your death

Mine is yours, mine is yours

In the wake of dawn
The mist of morning linger before it leaves
Invisible eyes, red reflection
It is you
Smiling in the midst of the moor

1572,The Night And The Silent Water,Opeth,"And so you left us
Jaded and gaunt, some September
Wilted with the seasons
But hidden inside the delusion
I saw your eyes, somewhere

Devoid of death
The aura poises amidst (the storm)
In solid tears I linger
A parlour glade, moonlit sorrow

Lonely resting pools
Relics of the moon-dogged lake
Whisper: ""All your words are misgiven""

Am I like them?
Those who mourn and turn away
Those who would give anything
To see you again
If only for another second

Your face was, like the photograph
Painted white
We did not speak very often about it
What does it matter now?

Cloak of autumn shroud
I gaze, dim ricochet of stars
I reckon it is time for me to leave

You sleep in the light
Yet the night and the silent water
Still so dark


",3
1573,To Bid You Farewell,Opeth,"I am awaiting
The sunrise
Gazing modestly through the coldest morning
Once it came you lied
Embracing us over
Autumn’s proud treetops

I stand motionless
In a parade of falling rain
Your voice I cannot hear
As I am falling again

Devotion eludes
And in sadness I lumber
In my own ashes
I am standing without a soul
She wept and whispered:
""I know…""

We walked into the night
Am I
To bid you farewell?
Why can’t you see
that I try?
When every tear I shed
Is for you?

Been a long time crossing
The bridge of sighs

Cold wind blows
The gods look down in anger
On this poor child

1575,Burden,Opeth,"I, once upon a time
Carried a burden inside
I sung a last goodbye
A broken rhyme I had underlined
There’s an ocean of sorrow in you

A sorrow in me

I saw a movement in their eyes
That said I no longer knew the way
I had given up the ghost
A passive mind submit to fear
And the wait for redemption at hand

Waiting to fail

Failing again

If death should take me now
Count my mistakes and let me through
Whisper in my ear
You have taken more than we’ve received
And the ocean of sorrow is you

1576,Coil,Opeth,"She told me why she told me lies
Always take care of this
I told her how I’ve always stayed
Always waiting for nothing

When I get out of here
When I leave you behind
I’ll find that the years passed us by

And I can see you
Riding through the fields of sorrow

1577,Derelict Herds,Opeth,"Someone died for looking too far
While I was asleep in my house
A child was killed, I heard it from a friend
A war raged in a distant land
Caused me to linger on a piece of text
Someone died
Not here, never here

There was a fever
There is a failure
Are you a believer?
Then someone lied to you

You hold it closer to your chest
There was a meaning for this test
But you forgot and it’s gone now
You were controlled somehow

There was a mean time
An invitation of sorts
I remember life
I, I was sick with sorrow

I’d fallen asleep
And dreamt of my sins here
It was your turn
Adamant smile and said, ""Thank you""

There was a sickness right in the family
While I shuddered in the cold
Woman hanged for her sins while I craved mine
An old man drowned in this life herd
As I made amends with my fathers

Someone died
Not here, never here

1578,Heir Apparent,Opeth,"Slow days
Slow words
Slow lies
Slow ends

So many years to clean the slate
Endless despair within its wake
His touch soiling what used to be clean
His gaze burning on the edge of our dreams no more

Slow pain
Slow deaths

And again he rides in, it’s September and he covets the gullible
Skeletal wish
Hunter
A thousand lies, cast from the throne of secrecy

Hear him spewing forth meaning to miserable lies
See the twisted hand of doubt seal the affair
The insect trust
Believer
Your body a vehicle to house his disease

Pearls before swine they are nothing but blind
Submit to nothing and swallow my spit of scorn
Invisible king
Dying
Procession of woe, struck down by sorrow
A burden so great weighs heavy on old and withered beliefs
The swift solution crumbles beneath the mock notes of a masterpiece
Death in his eyes
Waiting
Spiraling judgement, provoked in the rains

This futile test drowned in the levee of deception

In the year of his sovereign
Rid us of your judgement
Heir apparent

I said that I loved (eternal schemes)
I cling to my past (like childish dreams)
I promised to stay (and held my breath)
I went far away…

Icy roads beneath my feet
Lead me through wastelands of deceit
Rest your head now - don’t you cry
Don’t ever ask the reason why

Kept inside our idle race
Ghost of an idol’s false embrace
Rest your head now - don’t you cry
Don’t ever ask the reason why

1582,The Lotus Eater,Opeth,"The liquid is in your throat
One hopeless delight

After all you fell in love with death,
Life has aborted.
All you’ve had and all you became,
The night is calling, you pray for it.

A barren waste is your land
Your crops, they were sown to die

The skin is a mirror
Empty eyes hollow with ignorance
Health runs from your lips
Tucked in and safe in a world of sleep

All those years caring for a liar
A benefit road that is winding higher
You’re a moth too close to the fire

You are stuck in a route of confusion
Changing and waiting and seeking the truth of it all

Fleeing your sorrows
Pushing your spirit away

The weakness of the psyche
A whisper from the heart of evil luring them all into despair
Resenting the goods of a savior

And cries out
For the restless will also die

A selection culled from the damned, drawing a lifeline of one
A friend died in your room and sought the birth of a follower

O brother, you are a killer and you target yourself
I wish you had never come back for us to see the beckoning end

And the pride of a mother brought flaws in a mother’s son
And the love from a father was used by a father’s son

Overheard us talking in a smoke of lost hope
The language of a parting so clear and so true
Overheard us talking

Exchanging body heat in the passenger seat

I don’t look the same

Watching the sky fall

Letting the water fall

Happily ever after
How could I ask for more?

It feels like my heart is going to burst
Alone at a table for two
And I just wanna be served

And when you think of me
Am I the best you’ve ever had?
Share one more drink with me
Smile even though you’re sad

You shoulda’ seen what I wore
I had a cane and a party hat
I was the king of this hologram
Where there’s no such thing as getting out of hand
Memories tend to just pop up
Drunk pre-meds and some rubber gloves
Five-thousand people with designer drugs
Don’t think I’ll ever get enough (don’t think I’ll ever get enough)

A pack of camels and a smoke alarm

Upside down with a perfect view?

Lavish mansions, vintage wine

Snatch your chain and mace your eyes

Under the covers
With secondhand lovers

Stop thinking about
The bullets from my mouth

Just finished a daydream
Who were you trying to be

Then the time for being sad is over
And you miss them like you miss no other
And being blue is better than being over it (over it)

Breaks free of my wooden neck
Left to nod over sleeping waves
Like bobbing bait for bathing cod
Floating flocks of candle swans
Slowly drift across wax ponds

The men all played along to marching drums
And boy did they have fun behind the sea
They sang, (Hey!) ""so our matching legs are marching clocks
And we’re all too small to talk to god
Yes, we’re all too smart to talk to god""

Toast the fine folks casting silver crumbs
To us from the dock
Jinxed things ringing as they leak
Through tiny cracks in the boardwalk
Scarecrow now it’s time to hatch
Sprouting suns and ageless daughters
(Don’t you know?) Don’t you know?
That those watermelon smiles just can’t ripen underwater
Just can’t ripen underwater

Where summer’s lasted longer than
Longer than we do
When nothing really mattered
Except for me to be with you
But in time we all forgot and
We all grew

Your melody sounds as sweet
As the first time it was sung
With a little bit more character for show
And by the time your father’s heard
Of all the wrong you’ve done
Then I’m putting out the lantern
Find your own way back home

If I’ve forgotten how to sing
Before I sung this song
I’ll write it all across the wall
Before my job is done
And I’ll even have the courtesy
Of admitting I was wrong
As the final words before I’m dead and gone

You’ve never been so divine
In accepting your defeat
And I’ve never been more scared to be alone
If love is not enough to put my enemies to sleep
Then I’m putting out the lantern
Find your own way back home

This isn’t how he paid the bills before

Wound relentlessly
Around the words we used to sling
Oh, such torturous things
Always chewing up the only ones
I ever mean

If you’re goin’, then go
Go go go
If you’re goin’, then go
Go go go

Watch love
Get strangled by a kite’s cold strings
Fall comes early and summer leaves
As a storm with the car keys

Spark your heels
Up against the picket fence I built
All your wishes they will sink like stones
Slowly down a lonely well

Go spin circles for me
Wound relentlessly
Around the words we used to sling
Oh, such torturous things
Always chewing up the only ones
I ever mean

If you’re goin’, then go

Briefcase in hand
The stove is creeping up his spine again
Can’t get enough trash

He took the days for pageant
Became as mad as rabbits
With bushels of bad habits
And who could ask for anymore?
Yeah, who could have more?

His arms were the branches of a Christmas tree
Preached the devil in the belfry
He checked in
To learn his clothes had been thieved at the train station
Rope hung his other branch

And at the end was a dog called Bambi
Who was chewing on his parliaments
When he tried to save the calendar business
He tried to save the calendar business

He took the days for pageant
And became as mad as rabbits
With bushels of bad habits
Who could ask for anymore?
Who could have more?

The poor son of a humble chimney sweep
Fell to a cheap crowd
So stay asleep and put on that cursive type
You know we live in a toy

You know that Paul Cates bought himself a trumpet from the salvation army
But there ain’t no sunshine in his song
We must reinvent love

And that winding knee

You clicked your heels and wished for me

Through playful lips made of yarn

Unraveled words like moths upon old scarves

But melt your headaches, call it home

You put a sour little flavor in my mouth now
You move in circles hoping no one’s gonna find out

Kiss the ring and let ’em bow down
Looking for the time of your life

A pretty picture but the scenery is so loud
A face like heaven catching lighting in your nightgown
But back away from the water, babe, you might drown
The party isn’t over tonight

Conspire against the odds

The fear of falling apart
And truth be told, I never was yours

Confessing their apostasies
Lead away by imperfect impostors

Don’t try to sleep through the end of the world
And bury me alive

With an unrequited love
When your passion’s exaltation
Then finding refuge is not enough

She was the youngest of the family
And the last to be let go
When they decided they would try
And make it on their own

Oh, memories, where’d you go?
You were all I’ve ever known
How I miss yesterday
And how I let it fade away
Where’d you go?

When July became December
Their affection fought the cold
But they couldn’t quite remember
What inspired them to go

And it was beautifully depressing
Like A Streetcar Named Desire
They were fighting for their love
That started growing tired

Oh, memories, where’d you go?
You were all I’ve ever known
How I miss yesterday
And how I let it fade away
(Don’t fade away)

When the money lost momentum
And the bills were piling high
Then the smile had finally faded
From the apple of their eye

They were young and independent
And they thought they had it planned
Should’ve known right from the start
You can’t predict the end

Oh, memories, where’d you go?

How I miss yesterday

Before it tears down the walls (tear down the walls)

For that’s all that we’ve got
With all the blood that’s been shed, amongst the sands of time
How do we make it right?
How do we make it right? (don’t trust anymore)

Another city will fall

I will face the horror
So that you can turn away,
Turn away
So if I carry or am carried upon my shield,
I’m still between the Devil,
And the deep blue sea.

I am not alone,
I stand here with my brothers, with a will of steel.
But our hands, they still tremble because,
A man’s home is not here, through the smoke and mirrors,
We are men not machines, but we are just another piece.

I am cold, and I fear tonight, (and I fear)
We won’t get a second chance.

From the north, to the south.

Put your head to my chest and you will hear…

Is the sound of the emptiness flooding in.

Lift yourself from what’s below
Raise the anchor; bring it on home

Bring it on home
Bring it on home
Bring it on home

In a trail of fire, I know we will be free again
In the end we will be one
In a trail of fire, I’ll burn before you bury me
Set your sight for the sun

Bring it on home

Acting like it wouldn’t happen; making sense of anything that you could find
Because it’s just about to happen, and you’ll be there
You must have known the storm was coming when the clouds appeared

May as well let the rain come down
And join the circus of people while you’re there

Something is changing, bruising and aching
And I’m trying to find out what it is
When I fix her, she’s breaking; reason keeps escaping me
Protecting and burning like a cyst

I know that I can help you; I just don’t fucking want to
And the feeling gets stronger by the day
Say that I’m selfish, but I don’t really need this
And I’m just so sick of the chase

While you are letting your guard down, I will be letting myself go
While you keep running your ship aground, I will be setting myself alight

Too late; you dropped the drawbridge
You let the vampires in
You caused this shit to happen, and now you want out

Too late; you dropped the drawbridge
You let the vampires in
I hope you know now that it’s nobody’s fault but yours

Turning your head to see a new day calling

A snapshot from where you were born
I’m looking for your hand in the rough
You’re caught in the wire; well, I’ll lift you out

Leading on the action, caught in a cellphone’s rays
Bleeding on a sofa, staring at the wayside
He’s coming and she knows it, even though she knows why
Footsteps in the hallway; girl, you haven’t got time

You gotta get out
Go far away
You gotta get out
Go far away

Darkness in the bedroom; maybe she’s resting up
Maybe she was out late, just come back from the club
I can’t hear her breathing; something doesn’t seem right
Killer in the hallway; we’re living on a set time

We gotta get out

Hold the secret close

It throws about
It takes you in
And spits you out

It spits you out
When you desire
To conquer it
To feel you’re higher

To follow it
You must be cleaned
With mistakes
That you do mean

Move the heart, switch the pace
Look for what seems out of place

On and on it goes
Calling like a distant wind
Through the zero hour we’ll walk
We’ll cut the thick and break the thin

No sound to break, no moment clear
When all the doubts are crystal-clear
Crashing hard into the secret wind

Changing color
Spinning yarns

You know the way
It leaves you dry
It cuts you up
And takes you high

Is it cold

You’re scared that the past 3 haven’t lived past their 60’s and if you break the trend,
You’ll just end up like the old folks at Roland and 3939,
You’re scared because you’re an army brat of a man who died before his time.
I miss those summers, that grill smell, home cooked meals, take me back,
Sleeping like a log, healing so fast,
But losing you, I learned to lose my youth, lose my spirit, and now I can’t hear it anymore,
And I guess that’s life
Back then our body parts stayed in place,
We kept up with our own hearts,
It was so easy to temper the sting,
Just be fixed by a quick dip back in some old neighbor’s swimming pool
Now I’m just worn out, and I’ll ache like this forever I think,
These shoddy drapes refuse to keep the cold out
And this damn body can’t keep the warmth in,
I’m watching my hairline recede, I’m drinking fatigue, I’m fighting heredity
I see less of who I love the most, time’s getting away,
And we’re so slow to say how fast it goes,
I’m just looking for what’s coming, what’s built in the blood
But I’ve never been that sure of anything anyway
And I don’t want to heal, I’m just about the perfect amount to look how I feel
And I think about you laying there, waiting for her to get back,
I think about your last 3 breaths and I wonder if you knew,
I think about letting you go

It’s funny how you still apply, you still know me,
I’ll try to take your tools and make something worth while,
Try to make ya proud, I’ve learned nothing is spotless anymore,
But I’ll let you resonate…;

Maybe your Heaven is that Norman Rockwell scene
Where you and your friends are singing that Gordon Lightfoot song,
""If you could only read my mind,"" well if you could only read my mind,
Well that ending, it was just too hard to take,
Is it better than Clapton? Did you see your fathers eyes?
I know it’s wishful thinking hoping this won’t always kill me,
But If you saw yours, then I’ll see mine,
You finally stretched your feet and ghosted away from me,
You had to fade away, you had to leave
I’m pleading for one more time with what I know now,
I’m begging for the same flake to fall twice for the first time,

And I’m still singing, and you still can’t stay.

Because I still feel the lack long after.

I’ll always think it was too early to lose your shine,
I guess the means that ends us means nothing,
I just hope it’s the peace we all need,
Because I could love and drown in your God damned smile lines,
But I think I burnt up watching you rallying to stay alive,
And I guess that’s fine.
It seems we all get sick,
We all die in some no name hospital with the same colored walls,
And I guess that’s fine,
But I want to swallow, I want to stomach, I want to live.
It’s been a rough while and some days are worse than others,
There’s no proper way to feel, no mirth, no levity, no amazing grace,
Just a flame on a lake floating away,
I can’t let you lay,

Show him it was the wrong day
Show him that i’ve seen my reach

There ain't a thing that you can do that's gonna ruin my night
(But there's just something about)
This dizzy dreamer and her bleeding little blue boy
Licking your fingers like you're done
And you've decided there is so much more than me (Oh)
And baby, honestly it's harder breathing next to you
I shake, I brought a gun and as the preacher tried to stop me
Hold my heart, it's beating for you anyway

What if I can't forget you? (Oh)
I'll burn your name into my throat
I'll be the fire that'll catch you
And what's so good about pickin' up the pieces?
None of the colors ever light up anymore in this hole

Nobody prays for the heartless (No)
Nobody gives another penny for the selfish
(You're learning how to) Taste what you kill now
Don't mind me, I'm just reachin' for your necklace
Talkin' to my mom about this little girl from Texas

What if I can't forget you? (Oh)
I'll burn your name into my throat
I'll be the fire that'll catch you
And what's so good about pickin' up the pieces?

Just give her back to me
You know I can't afford the medicine that feeds what I need
So baby, what if I can't forget you? (What if I can't forget you?)

And just throw, oh no

You can't just throw me away

In our comfort zone
Reminds me of the second time
That I followed you home

We’re running out of alibis
On the second of May
Reminds me of the summertime
On this winter’s day

See you at the bitter end
See you at the bitter end

Every step we take that’s synchronized
Every broken bone
Reminds me of the second time
That I followed you home

You shower me with lullabies
As you’re walking away
Reminds me that it’s killing time
On this fateful day

See you at the bitter end
See you at the bitter end
See you at the bitter end
See you at the bitter end

From the time we intercepted
Feels a lot like suicide
Slow and sad, grown inside us
(See you at the bitter end)
Arouse and see you’re mine

Love has seen your run-around
Who wanna seek you now?
I want a peace
I’d whine out
(See you at the bitter end)

Love’s reached his side
Grab this gentleness inside
Heard a cry
Six feet down
(See you at the bitter end)
In six weeks’ time
The mess you left
Will end

Carve your name into my arm
Instead of stressed I lie here charmed
’Cause there’s nothing else to do
Every me and every you

Sucker love a box I choose
No other box I choose to use
Another love I would abuse
No circumstances could excuse

In the shape of things to come
Too much poison come undone
’Cause there’s nothing else to do
Every me and every you
Every me and every you
Every me

Sucker love is known to swing
Prone to cling and waste these things
Pucker up for heaven’s sake
There’s never been so much at stake

I served my head up on a plate
It’s only comfort calling late
’Cause there’s nothing else to do
Every me and every you
Every me and every you
Every me
Every me and every you
Every me

Like the naked leads the blind
I know I’m selfish I’m unkind
Sucker love, I always find
Someone to bruise and leave behind

All alone in space and time
There’s nothing here, but what here’s mine
Something borrowed, something blue
Every me and every you
Every me and every you

I’m feeling so fucking good right now, I want it to last
So I put my phone on silent, and I refill my glass
The music’s so fucking banging, feel like I wanna dance
I’m at the bar and I see a chick checking me out,
From afar yeah, she wants my dick, there ain’t a doubt,
She’s got a skirt so short, make you drool from the mouth,
Lookin’ my way as if to say I’m in with a shout,
so I pull a chair over there and buy her a drink,
She says ’Cheers’, I say ’Yeah’, our glasses go clink,
Now I’m being bad in the car rubbing this girl,
Once the cab is paid we make our way up to the hotel,
Now I’m in the lift, getting lips, oh this is wrong,
But do I care? Do I fuck! I’m on a roll, yo!

1728,Youth Of The Nation,POD,"Last day of the rest of my life
I wish I would've known
Cause I would've kissed my mama goodbye

I didn't tell her that I loved her and how much I care
Or thank my pops for all the talks
And all the wisdom he shared

Unaware, I just did what I always do
Everyday, the same routine
Before I skate off to school

But who knew that this day wasn't like the rest
Instead of taking a test
I took two to the chest

Call me blind, but I didn't see it coming
Everybody was running
But I couldn't hear nothing

Except gun blasts, it happened so fast
I didn't really know this kid
He wasn't part of the class

Maybe this kid was reaching out for love
Or maybe for a moment
He forgot who he was

Or maybe this kid just wanted to be hugged
Whatever it was
I know it's because

We are, we are, the youth of the nation
We are, we are, youth of the nation
We are, we are, the youth of the nation
We are, we are, youth of the nation

Little Suzy, she was only twelve
She was given the world
With every chance to excel

Hang with the boys and hear the stories they tell
She might act kind of proud
But no respect for herself

She finds love in all the wrong places
The same situations
Just different faces

Changed up her pace since her daddy left her
Too bad he never told her
She deserved much better

Johnny boy always played the fool
He broke all the rules
So you would think he was cool

He was never really one of the guys
No matter how hard he tried
Often thought of suicide

It's kind of hard when you ain't got no friends
He put his life to an end
They might remember him then

You cross the line and there's no turning back
Told the world how he felt
With the sound of a gat

We are, we are, the youth of the nation
We are, we are, youth of the nation
We are, we are, the youth of the nation
We are, we are, youth of the nation

Who's to blame for the lives that tragedies claim
No matter what you say
It don't take away the pain

That I feel inside, I'm tired of all the lies
Don't nobody know why
It's the blind leading the blind

I guess that's the way the story goes
Will it ever make sense
Somebody's got to know

There's got to be more to life than this
There's got to be more to everything
I thought exists

We are, we are, the youth of the nation
We are, we are, youth of the nation
We are, we are, (we are, we are) the youth of the nation
We are, we are, (we are, we are) youth of the nation

These crowns of illusion are fooling us all
And now I am weary, and I feel like I do

It’s only you, who can tell me apart
And it’s only you, who can turn my wooden heart

The size of our fight, it’s just a dream
We’ve crushed everything, I can see, in this morning selfishly
How we’ve failed, and I feel like I do

It’s only you, who can tell me apart
And it’s only you, who can turn my wooden heart

Now that we’ve chosen to take all we can
This shade of autumn, a stale bitter end
Years of frustration lay down side by side

There’s a new housing plan for the ghetto eventually
Projects for a new American century
False-flag terrorism controlling you mentally
The gospel in the hands of people with no empathy
A mixture of dangerous social chemistry
Between law enforcement and a military entity
Cameras on the corner of every corner you’re facing
Testing out a future gestapo on immigration
Power consolidation, information restricted
Just like the iron law of oligarchy predicted
Incarcerating the poor among the drug addicted
But not the families of the ruling class that’s afflicted
’Cause it’s a fuckin’ caste system like corrupted Hinduism
I think you should listen, I been through the system in prison
I been through religion, carried the cross as a Christian
Like it was antidisestablishmentarianism
Until the seeds of despotism arrested my vision
Lyricism with cynicism and syllogisms
Until they Pedro Albizu Campos and kill me in prison

The birth of neo-con policy, but I laughed at America’s fear

A decade of the weapon of sound above ground
Ain’t no shelter if you’re looking for shade
I lick shots at the brutal charade

As the polls close like a casket
Our truth devours a silent play in the shadow of power
A spectacle monopolized
The camera’s eyes on choice disguised

Was it cast for the mass who burn and toil?
Or for the vultures who thirst for blood and oil?
It’s a spectacle monopolized
They hold the reins, stole your eyes

The Fistagon’s bullets and bombs
Who stuff the banks, who staff the party ranks
More for Gore or the son of a drug lord?
None of the above, fuck it, cut the cord

’Cause the getaway car just sped away

Probably a robbery

I heard alarm bells ringing, shouts of “stay where you are!”
There wasn’t time to blink

Threw me arms in the air, slung down the bag with tools
The worst thing about it, I’d just booked me cruise

’Cause the getaway car just sped away

Started as a dipper
But I married a stripper

I’m here in wait
For a suitable date

1786,Audience Of One,Rise Against,"I can still remember
The words and what they meant
As we etched them with our fingers
In years of wet cement

The days blurred into each other
Though everything seemed clear
We cruised along at half speed
But then we shifted gears

We ran like vampires from a thousand burning suns
But even then, we should have stayed

But we ran away
Now all my friends are gone
Maybe we’ve outgrown all the things that we once loved
Run away
But what are we running from?
A show of hands from those in this audience of one
Where have they gone?

Identities assume us
As nine and five add up
Synchronizing watches
With the seconds that we lost
And I looked up and saw you
I know that you saw me
We froze but for a moment
In empathy

I brought down the sky for you, but all you did was shrug
You gave my emptiness a name

And you ran away
Now all my friends are gone
Maybe we’ve outgrown all the things that we once loved
Run away
But what are we running from?
A show of hands from those in this audience of one
Where have they gone?

We’re all OK, until the day we’re not
The surface shines, while the inside rots
We raced the sunset and we almost won
We slammed the brakes, but the wheels went on

And we ran away
Now all my friends gone
Maybe we’ve outgrown all the things that we once loved
Run away
But what are we running from?
A show of hands from those in this audience of one
Where have they gone?

1787,Collapse (Post-Amerika),Rise Against,"When our rivers run dry and our crops cease to grow
And when our summers grow longer and winters won’t snow
From the banks of the ocean and the ice in the hills
To the fight in the desert where progress stands still
When we’ve lost our will

That’s how we’ll know
This is not a test, oh no
This is cardiac arrest
Of a world too proud to admit our mistakes
We’re crashing into the ground as we all fall from grace

When the air that we breathe becomes air that we choke
When the marsh fever spreads from the swamps to our homes
When your home on the range has been torn down and paved and
The buffalo roam to a slaughterhouse grave
What more will it take

For us to know
This is not a test, oh no
This is cardiac arrest
Of a world too proud to admit our mistakes
Kissing the ground as we all fall from grace

This is a chance to set things straight
To bend or break the rules back into place
There is no middle ground, no compromise, we’ve drawn the line
With perfect aim, we stand back and throw
Glass windows break and its all about to blow
Lights go out as we pass the torch again
In hope that it stays lit

Neutrality means that you don’t really care
Cause the struggle goes on even when you’re not there
Blind and unaware…

That’s how we’ll know
This is not a test, oh no
This is cardiac arrest
Of a world too proud to admit our mistakes
We’re crashing into the ground as we all, yeah we all, all fall from grace

1788,Entertainment,Rise Against,"All we are is entertainment
Caught up in our own derangement
Tell us what to say and what to do
All we are are pretty faces
Picture perfect bottled rage
Packaged synthesized versions of you

We’ve all made petty fortunes, but we can’t afford a life (whoa)
Confined to pull-out quotes and hotel rooms (hey, hey, hey, hey)
They all scream California and its toppling empire
But can’t you see the end is coming soon

Hey!

Come one, come all, the new sensation
Guarantees then obligations
Spotlights follow every single move (move, move, move)
Basking here on ten foot stages
Pouty lips and oh so jaded
All as if we have something to prove

Despite these petty fortunes we still can’t afford a life (whoa)
Confined to pull-out quotes and hotel rooms (hey, hey, hey, hey)
They all scream California and its toppling empire
But can’t you see the end is here

And if we cared at all
About this unknown plight
Then we’d do something more
To finally make this right

Is this only entertainment
Pull the curtains, places please
We’ve learned to sing and dance and cry on cue
But this is more than entertainment
In a world so sick with pain
This is the only thing that’s real or true

We’ve all made petty fortunes, but we can’t afford a life (whoa)
Confined to pull-out quotes and hotel rooms (hey, hey, hey, hey)
They all scream bloody murder over graves already dug
But can’t you see the end…

1789,From Heads Unworthy,Rise Against,"We are the children you reject and disregard
These aching cries come from the bottom of our hearts
You can’t disown us now, we are your own flesh and blood
And we don’t disappear just because your eyes are shut, now tell me

Love, loss, like a bullet’s path
Tear through the cavity of my chest
Lights out because the fuse has blown

As their castles crumble slowly (watch them fall)
We watch them fall (watch them fall)
The crown slips from heads unworthy (watch them fall)
As we gain control

This is the family that we crossed or never had
This is a war that was lost the day it began
Because it’s the race we run, but it keeps us at the start
And it’s the song I sung from the bottom of my heart, that’s how we

Read you like a polygraph
Not one single bone in your back
Own up to how you let us down

As their castles crumble slowly (watch them fall)
We watch them fall (watch them fall)
The crown slips from heads unworthy (watch them fall)
As we gain control

Except for you and me, love
Everyone is the same, we know
We know, we know, we know

But if to live, we have to be numb
I’d rather know the pain
I’d rather know, I’d rather know

This happens almost never
But it happened once to me
And this will never be same

The ends we seam together

I’m not after fame and fortune
I’m after you
When I’ve served my time
I swear I will come back for you

(Watch them fall…)

As their castles crumble slowly (watch them fall)
We watch them fall (watch them fall)
The crown slips from heads unworthy
Right on to ours, but I’m after you
But I’m after you
I’m after you
And I’m after you

1790,Hairline Fracture,Rise Against,"A sinking ship, an awkward kiss
A chance to set things straight
The kind of hurt that burns and burns
Like fires we can’t contain

We hole up in a shelter made of bones and ice and there we’ll wait
So start again with steady hands
This time nothing gets in our way
But as we peer a little closer what do we see?

A crack in the surface
A flaw in the plan (plans we made together, almost buried in the sand)
A cadence imperfect
Like a building condemned (can we indemnify ourselves if we don’t face what we’re against)

A promise kept
The dirt unswept
A poorly worn disguise
A child unloved that then grows up
To love what we despise

We’re broken but still breathing
We are wounded but we are healing
We pick up right where we left off
Breathe on the ashes that remain

So that these coals may become fire
To guide our way

A crack in the surface
A flaw in the plan (plans we made together, almost buried in the sand)
A cadence imperfect
Like a building condemned (can we indemnify ourselves if we don’t face what we’re against)

I walk on wounds
That seldom prove to slow me down
I laugh this constant pain away
So you can’t tell
But there it lies under the smiles
It drains me mile after mile
But seldom proves to slow me down

Here I go…
Here I go…
Here I go…

Should we just hold on
To what remains of
What we thought was lost

But it’s just a crack in the surface
A flaw in the plan (plans we made together, almost buried in the sand)
A cadence imperfect
Like a building condemned (can we indemnify ourselves if we don’t face what we’re against)

A crack in the surface…

1791,Hero Of War,Rise Against,"He said ""Son, have you seen the world?
Well, what would you say if I said that you could?
Just carry this gun, you’ll even get paid.""
I said ""That sounds pretty good.""

Black leather boots
Spit-shined so bright
They cut off my hair but it looked alright
We marched and we sang
We all became friends
As we learned how to fight

A hero of war
Yeah that’s what I’ll be
And when I come home
They’ll be damn proud of me
I’ll carry this flag
To the grave if I must
’Cause it’s a flag that I love
And a flag that I trust

I kicked in the door
I yelled my commands
The children, they cried
But I got my man
We took him away
A bag over his face
From his family and his friends

They took off his clothes
They pissed in his hands
I told them to stop
But then I joined in
We beat him with guns
And batons not just once
But again and again

A hero of war
Yeah that’s what I’ll be
And when I come home
They’ll be damn proud of me
I’ll carry this flag
To the grave if I must
’Cause it’s a flag that I love
And a flag that I trust

She walked through bullets and haze
I asked her to stop
I begged her to stay
But she pressed on
So I lifted my gun
And I fired away

And the shells jumped through the smoke
And into the sand
That the blood now had soaked
She collapsed with a flag in her hand
A flag white as snow

A hero of war
Is that what they see
Just medals and scars
So damn proud of me
And I brought home that flag
Now it gathers dust
But it’s a flag that I love
It’s the only flag I trust

He said, ""Son, have you seen the world?
Well what would you say, if I said that you could?""

We’re all overdue
Can there be a place to call our own?
Can there be a road that takes us home?

We toe the line (toe the line)
We go along (we go along)
We toe the line
To you now

When it rains it pours
Like summer storms, the skies as grey as leaves
The rivers flood the banks and spill into the streets
But the people laughed and swore that they’d restore
The city piece by piece
And then the clouds gave way as if to agree
When it rains it pours

The mystery unknown now unfolds
The life that we once owned, first bought, then sold
Like messengers of war, we’ve no control
To oceans unexplored
This ship sails through

We toe the line (toe the line)

When it hit, we swore
Now we want not more
Like a saint re-born
Like a rose in a storm
Like a child un-born
A child un-born…

It’s the coin we’re tossing into the well
It’s misfortune that we could not foretell
It’s the dry spell

When it rains it pours
Like summer storms, the skies as grey as leaves
The rivers flood the banks and spill into the streets
But the people laughed and swore that they’d restore
The city piece by piece

1793,Kotov Syndrome,Rise Against,"They’re high on the watchtower,
Keeping the peace…;
Whatever that means.
Because you see the world grow,
Crosshairs and TVs, don’t you?

Ten foot walls built around us,
White picket death.
So quiet, so safe.
But if we fall there will be nothing, and no one to catch us.
Sit back and watch as we…;

Spin out of control,
Spin out of control,
Try to recover, but collide with each other.
We spin out of control,

Something I can’t change,
I was born in a place,
That lives by the sword.
And thus to it’s blade we’re condemned.
Don’t you understand why we scream ""no more.""? (no more!)

My dreams are of children,
Orphaned by blood,
Spilt at these hands.
Here on the graves of the innocent,
We raise our flag.

Spin out of control,
Spin out of control,
Try to recover, but collide with each other.
We spin out of control.

Some things you don’t forgive, some things you don’t forget.
Sometimes the fate you suffer is so much worse than death.
We’re way off course now and we’re drifting out to sea.
So cut the anchor on your heart to be set free,
Set free,
Set free!

Before we crash, one after the other.

1794,Long Forgotten Sons,Rise Against,"Far from home on a road unknown
Where the vultures circle on winds that blow
From northern skies that haunt these waking moments
On shadows cast by the mountain range
On calloused soles we find our way
Through desperate eyes, we long for the horizon
While this sun is rising

We are the long forgotten sons
And daughters that don’t belong to anyone
We are alone under this sun
We work to fix the work that you’ve undone

When cries for help go unanswered
And signal fires just burn and burn
We wonder if we’re waiting here for nothing
’Cause our lips are sewn our ears are filled
With the constant drone of the unfulfilled
But we’ll never fall if we stand for something
We stand for something

We are the long forgotten sons
And daughters that don’t belong to anyone
We are alone under this sun
We work to fix the work that you’ve undone

Don’t fall, I see lights in the distance
They’re not far away
Stand up because the sky is turning gray

There’s hope in these footsteps of persistence
So don’t go astray
These lights get closer everyday

We are the long forgotten sons
Yeah, we are the long forgotten sons

We are the long forgotten sons
And daughters that don’t belong to anyone

To the rhythm of the awful rusting machines

Each breath we take makes us thieves
Like causes without rebels
Just talk but promise nothing else

We crawl on our knees for you
Under a sky no longer blue
We sweat all day long for you
But we sow seeds to see us through
’Cause sometimes dreams just don’t come true
We wait to reap what we are due

To the rhythm of a time bomb ticking away
And the blare of the sirens combing the street
Chased down like dogs we run from
Your grasp until the sun comes up

We crawl on our knees for you
Under a sky no longer blue
We sweat all day long for you
But we sow seeds to see us through
’Cause sometimes dreams just don’t come true
Look now at what they’ve done to you

White needles buried in the red
The engine roars and then it gives
But never dies
’Cause we don’t live
We just survive
On the scraps that you throw away

I won’t crawl on my knees for you
I won’t believe the lies that hide the truth
I won’t sweat one more drop for you
’Cause we are the rust upon your gears
We are the insect in your ears
We crawl…
We crawl…
We crawl all over you!

We sow seeds to see us through
Our days are precious and so few
We all reap what we are due
Under this sky no longer blue
We bring a dawn long overdue

Through the valleys of an aging face that this world has forgotten

There is no reconciliation that will put me in my place
And there is no time like the present to drink these draining seconds
But seldom do these words ring true when I’m constantly failing you
Like walls that we just can’t break through until we disappear

So tell me now if this ain’t love then how do we get out?
’Cause I don’t know

I just want to save you while there’s still something left to save
That’s when I told her I love you girl
But I’m not the answer for the questions that you still have, oh, oh

And the day pressed on like crushing weights
For no man does it ever wait
Like memories of dying days that deafen us like hurricanes
Bathed in flames we held the brand, uncurled the fingers in your hand
Pressed into the flesh like sand, now do you understand?

So tell me now if this ain’t love then how do we get out?

That’s when she said I don’t hate you boy

Where we danced just to please the gods that only ask for more
And so it goes

But still we give ourselves to this
We can’t spend our lives waiting to live

On cold nights
In a prayer for dawn
The daylight

Through the cracks I slip

The postcard says wish you were here
But I’d rather I was there

Be there before dawn

1804,Halfway There,Rise Against,"Is this the point where we give up?
Now is this the point where we give in?
Now is this the point where we turn ourselves in?

Or is this the time to ask questions?
Or is this the time to seek answers?
Now is this the time to throw it all in?

When enough is enough that’s when you know that you’re halfway there
When enough is enough that’s when you know that you’re halfway there
You’re halfway there
That’s when you know that you’re halfway there

This is the point where we stand up
Now this is the point where we take back
The things that are keeping us from being free

So when enough is enough that’s when you know that you’re halfway there
When enough is enough that’s when you know that you’re halfway there

Woah, woah
Your voice the airwaves sent you prayed my life would end
Woah, woah
The wasted time I spent ashamed I called you friend
Woah, woah
Give me one reason, I need a reason
Woah, woah
Give me one reason, I need a reason, one reason

1805,Heaven Knows,Rise Against,"The day I learn to fly
I’m never coming down
On perfect wings I’ll rise
Through the layers of the clouds

And from there I see the neon grids of cities
Where six million people that keep their fires lit

And I threw a party in my name
But the hours crawled by and no one came
So I bowed my head and I prayed for wings
To take me from this place from you

I see myself inside you
You dream the dreams that I do
You’re still searching for these answers
They’re not inside your wrist

And from there I see the neon grids of cities
Where six million people that can keep their fires lit

And I threw a party in my name
But the hours crawled by and no one came
So I bowed my head and I prayed for wings
To take me from this place from you

And I close my eyes as the curtains draw
I thought I heard your voice but I thought wrong
’Cause you’re not there anymore
No, you’re not there anymore

And so I lift my chin as the show goes on
The sky is listening, the stars all sing along
But you’re not there anymore
And I just can’t care anymore

(And you’ll never be a freak ’cause you’re just… too perfect)

Late nights and bloodshot eyes
Clock ticking half past five
We’re barely breathing but we’re still alive
Go!

Our plans are all laid out
Take all these unmarked roads
We blaze the trails to places no one goes
Yeah!

One last chance to go
If I don’t leave tonight I never will
Let’s go!
One last chance to go
Let’s take it now, in for the kill

In time we find ourselves
Back where we started from
Too weak to fight and much too tired to run
Yeah!

Before you swallow me
Into your perfect life
I’m not going out without a fight

One last chance to go
If I don’t leave tonight I never will
Let’s go!
One last chance to go
Let’s take it now, in for the kill

(If I had to leave tonight would you come with me?)
(What?)
(If I had to go to New York, and live, tonight, would you come with me?)

But this blueprint’s faded grey
And here it seems like just yesterday
When we mapped out the details of our great escape

But still these roads all beckon me
To uncover their mystery
But I fall like dead autumn leaves
And let the jetstream carry me

One last chance to go
If I don’t leave tonight I never will
Let’s go!
One last chance to go

1807,Like The Angel,Rise Against,"They turn the lights down low
In shadows hiding from the world
Only coming out when it gets cold

The seas part when they hit the floor
The voices carry on and out the door
And everything you touch turns into gold

Like the angel you are
You laugh, creating a lightness in my chest
Your eyes, they penetrate me
Your answer’s always ’maybe’
That’s when I got up and left

A beating heart, a microphone
A ticking clock in an empty home
Still tells of these times so long ago

And even though I’ve come so far
I know I’ve got so far to go
And any day now I’ll explode

Like the angel you are
You laugh, creating a lightness in my chest
Your eyes, they penetrate me
Your answer’s always ’maybe’
That’s when I got up and left

And each and everyday, we’ll lead into tomorrow
Tomorrow brings one less day without you
But don’t wait up, just leave the light on
’Cause all the roads that I might take
Will all one day lead back to you

Your eyes, they penetrate me

I’d draw bullseye on your forehead

Is time gone to waste

Cast the stones that I’ll gladly catch
And I’ll throw them right fucking back
I stand behind the things I say
You type the words you won’t say to my face

Time spent on hate
Is time gone to waste
I watch you point and click your life away

It seems you’ve let me go again (Let go!)
Just like the day you let me in (Let go!)

You were never mine to begin, begin with

So step away from the fucking screen
See a world outside your scene
Maybe then you will know
And realize the lack of threat you pose

On windy nights I can smell the lake as it drifts to me from the shore

Yeah, I’m still waiting

And if my hand could block the sun
Would we ever wake up?
And if I turned back all these clocks
Would that be time enough?

I can’t remember exactly when this longing began
But I know it wasn’t before the day you touched my hand
Laugh and shout in blissful daze and numbers are exchanged
But, I’m still waiting
Yeah, I’m still waiting

And if my hands could block the sun
Would we ever wake up?
And if I turned back all these clocks
Would that be time enough?

So put your hands where I can see them
And shut your mouth
I know who you are
In a world void of feeling or heart
I know that we are the torches in the dark

Let’s make this count
Let’s leave this one-horse town
No better time than now

Let’s break this down
Let’s make this count
Let’s leave this one-horse town
No better time than now

The angels dance, like feathers float
They’re here to see and to be seen
The clock strikes two, the music slows
And each one slowly dons their wings

Once outside they all pair off
And hand in hand they leave

1810,Voices Off Camera,Rise Against,"Can you hear
The desperate cries that are calling out your name
Twisting your arm
Holding out their hands and tugging at your sleeve

Do you feel
This underlying sense of urgency
Or are you as blind as me?

I hit the ground and I’m still running
But I need a place to stay tonight
I swear I’ll be gone in the morning
I just need somewhere now

I can’t bear the thought of losing
I dread the attention winning brings
And ever since the day I came here
I can stand without your strings

I’m so sick of all these people
But I’m scared to be alone
And if this life has taught me anything
I forgot it long ago

And so I hit the ground and I’m still running
But I need a place to stay tonight
I swear I’ll be gone in the morning
I just need somewhere warm to close my eyes

Hit the ground and I’m still running
But I need a place to stay tonight
I swear I’ll be gone in the morning
I just need somewhere warm to close my eyes

The heart is something
You can’t control
We either choose to follow
Or be left on our own

So we’re leaving here on
Our less-traveled road
As our desperate cries grow louder
I know we’re getting close, getting close

And so I hit the ground and I’m still running
But I need a place to stay tonight
I swear I’ll be gone in the morning

1811,A Beautiful Indifference,Rise Against,"There’s a struggle coming, but to conquer, first they must divide
The machines keep humming night and day
How are we so unaware
Why are you not afraid?

Protests are drumming while you turn your nose and roll your eyes
Knee-jerk reactions so ingrained
Judging from an arm chair

Cause there is hate and there is love and there is loss
But there is light and there is dark, then there is us
And whether this world burns, is none of your concern
Caught up in a ticker-tape parade

I have learned to stand up and just to walk away
Sometimes the cold hearts aren’t worth the love or the hate
Learn to let go, learn to walk away
Up from the shadows I’m seduced by the light of the flame
But this time I’m here to stay

Gunpowder residue, bright lights and turpentine
True colors shining through, as we are stripped of our exteriors

Now, cause there is hate and there is love and there is loss
But there is right and there is wrong, then there is us
We’re falling until

We learn to stand up and just to walk away
Sometimes the cold hearts aren’t worth the love or the hate
Learn to let go, learn to walk away
Up from the shadows I’m seduced by the light of the flame
But this time I’m here to stay

Feet first into the quicksand, every day we are surrendering
Never straying from the game plan
I keep hoping you will take my hand and stand up

The water’s overflowing, the walls are breaking
But I know where I’m going, that we can make it
And there’s a light still glowing and I will chase it
And I’ve been lost before and I have been led astray

But this time I’m here to stay

1812,Awake Too Long,Rise Against,"I watched the rise and the fall of the common man
I lived to see all our steps walked back
I watched the walls all crash down crumbling
Just to be rebuilt while we slept

We threw swords in the oceans wide and deep
We promise peace but the peace won’t last
Because now we forge new blades so nervously
Waiting for this harmony to pass

I stand guard and roam
Like a sentinel and I see it all

I’ve been awake too long
Wish there was something
That could close my eyes to all that I see
Awake too long, it would be easier to fall asleep

We fell in love but the love kept running out
We followed roads but the roads all end
We lived and learned and learned to live without
Falling from the ladders we ascend

I’ve seen the eyes of the widows left behind
I’ve seen the child of a fallen man
And never once did our leaders apologize
For battles they began

Can’t look away
Or pretend not to see and so I stay

I’ve been awake too long
Wish there was something
That could close my eyes to all that I see
Awake too long, it would be easier to fall asleep, asleep

Maybe I would dream if I could sleep
Maybe I’d see what this could be
Instead of what it is
Is there bliss in ignorance
Is this our demise we can’t prevent
Should we fall asleep?

I’ve been awake too long
I’ve been awake too long
I’ve been awake too long
I’ve been awake too long

(I’ve been awake too long) And like constant vigils
(I’ve been awake too long) We are burning eternal flames
(I’ve been awake too long) A surgery, blades in an open heart
(I’ve been awake too long) And through it all, it all
Every single cut, I’ve been awake

1813,Bridges,Rise Against,"In a world of uncertainty
The night sky told us all to be patient
But when the ground started shaking
I wondered for how long

There’s a place that I’d rather be
There’s a voice deep inside of me
Saying the progress we are making
Is not progress at all

Into a world of promises, whoa
Is where we let ourselves been led

We built the bridges
We now sleep under
We frame the door ways
But may not pass through

The very same roads
That we now wander
Ones you pass us by on
We paved with our bare hands
Paved with our bare hands

A black cloud hovers over me
Without all this guilt I feel naked
Something about the way it
Wraps its arms around
White snow covers everything
An angel watches over me
Praying, she asks me for a favor
Catch me if I fall

A rush of blood straight to the head, whoa
I wonder what this could have been

We built the bridges
We now sleep under
We frame the door ways
But may not pass through

The very same roads
That we now wander
Ones you pass us by on
We paved with our bare hands
Paved with our bare hands
Hey!

No I never meant to hurt you
No I never meant to do you wrong
I stood waiting while the man said move along

We lay the tracks down
But now they rotted
Like a runaway train
We brace for the crash

We were in love once
Have you forgotten?
Like a runaway train
Bearing down upon a gap

We built the bridges (brace for the crash)
(Built from their hypocrisy)
We built the bridges (brace for the crash)
(and now we brace for the crash)
We built the bridges (brace for the crash)
(Built from their hypocrisy)
We built the bridges (brace for the crash)

Potent but not real, left you wanting more

Lipstick track marks bleeding wet
Like Montagues and Capulets
For us child the stars refuse to shine
Oh why for us, child, do the stars refuse to shine?

Somewhere strung out on the lam
We wound up back here again
Like unstable chemicals
Combining only to explode

What will it take for you to notice?
I am a heart on fire, and all the world’s a fuse
So don’t get close
Trouble and the worth
Am I better off on my own?

Contaminated, quarantined then left alone
A shipment refused, address unknown
A damaged goods they soon forget
The choking dust that we got left
For us all, the stars refuse to shine

Tap the vein and light the match
We burn like stars before the crash
But for you there’s still a chance
Just let go

What will it take for you to notice?
I am a heart on fire, and all the world’s a fuse
So don’t get close
Trouble and the worth
I’m better off on my own
On my own

Now there’s nowhere to run
And yeah there’s nowhere to hide
There’s nothing under the sun
We haven’t already tried

What will it take for you to notice?

And I burned every picture of yours
Was that not enough?

My gun is bigger than yours
So let’s arm the masses
And see what the bastards do then
Walking tall once set us apart
Now we’re down on all fours
Do you cry my name in the dark
Like I do yours?

These storms are getting stronger now
Trusses all bend and sway
Lightning hits, the power goes out in the fray
As the waves crash high
And the shoreline disappears
I will scream to the sky
""Hey, people live here.""

My dreams are not unlike yours
They long for the safety
And break like a glass chandelier
But there’s laughter and oh there is love
Just past the edge of our fears
And there’s chaos when push comes to shove
But it’s music to my ears

May you be in Heaven before the Devil knows you’re dead
May these winds be always at your back

’Cause when we’re all just ghosts
And the madness overtakes us
We will look at the ashes
And say, ""People lived here.""

From the penthouse to the holy martyr
Sea to shining sea
From the coffins full of kindergartners
Is this what you call free?
From the hate that drips from all your crosses
Are your hands so clean?

And the wildfire and it’s spreading far
From sea to shining sea

When we’re all just ghosts
And the madness overtakes us
I will scream to the sky
Yeah I’ll scream to the sky
Yeah I’ll scream to the sky
""Hey, people live here.""

We used to race a thousand miles a day so fast
Feet they barely even touched the ground
We used to fly to places out beyond our own little world
The fury and the sound

I saw it flicker like a television set
Bright flashes of a warning sign
Flipping channels in a world gone static
Eroding away line by fading line

Underwater for years we found
So much harder to swim than drown
The current takes us now we’re walking into the light

Down til it’s gone an echo of a song

Flat line and a closing bell whisper a warm farewell
The flames are beckoning as we’re walking into the light

Let life flash right before your eyes

Grow slimmer ’til there’s no chance at all

Trade misery like diamonds and gold
The angst that we exchange for applause and petty praise
Is finally now taking its toll

Or well-spent, is still time

Moments of clarity here are short-lived
Bled through the bandages again
When is a lie no longer white
But black as a day without sun

Passed out in a gutter

The same touch that heals me
Left a scar

Showing it to everyone
On his mobilephone
He’s got a picture of his son
There’s a mormon preacher -
Black suit and a tie
The train left the station
Kiev, goodbye!
Let’s introduce ourselves - we’re sitting on a train
That takes us to Berlin from Ukraine

The wheels go round, the beat goes faster
It’s my favourite tune on the Sovietoblaster!
And everyone here drinks vodka and beer
And the dancing queen of Kiev, Ukraine
Drives every boy insane!

From Ukraine with love
I’m like a spy on a mission in a
Palace on wheels
With no air conditioner
It’s hot as hell
But we don’t care
We have two days
And one night to spare
Our small compartment’s
Like a telephone cell
Everyone here
Has stories to tell
We are in no hurry
We’ve got plenty of time
Tell me your lifestory
I’ll tell you mine

Another round of drinks
Now take out your guitar
There’s a party
In the dining car!

I once used to live here
Now I came back
For these old soviet records
Now they are all in my bag -
Dozens of vinyls
As heavy as bricks
Bringing death to DJs
With all their tricks!

Forget your Top 10!
I’ve got some LPs
That are 100 times funkier
Than Black Eyed Peas!
Crazy balalaikas from
Nineteen Sixty-Five!
You’ve been dreaming to hear it
All of your life!

When there’s no wodka left
What shall we do, my friends?
Lets forget our troubles
And dance!

1824,Out Of The Black,Royal Blood,"How did it feel when it came alive and took you?
Out of the black
It broke your skin and shook through
Every part of me, every part of you

You made a fool out of me
And took the skin off my back running
So don’t breathe when I talk
’Cause you haven’t been spoken to

I got a gun for a mouth
And a bullet with your name on it
But a trigger for a heart
Beating blood from an empty pocket

I never knew why
And you didn’t care when
You closed every door
And washed away no sin

And I promised you
Like you promised me
But those vows we made
Fucked them up for free, yeah

You made a fool out of me
And took the skin off my back running

But don’t push my limits too far”

I don’t understand these boundaries”
She said, “Just don’t disappoint me,
You know how complex women are”

When we started on traditional roles
She said, “Sure, I’ll be your partner,
But don’t make too many demands”

I said, “If love has these conditions,
I don’t understand those songs you love”
She said, “This is not a love song,
Thes isn’t fantasyland”

1826,The Speed of Love,Rush,"Love is born with lightning bolts
Electro-magnetic force
Burning skin and fireworks
A storm on a raging course

Like a force of nature
Love can fade with the stars at dawn
Sometimes it takes all your strength
Just to keep holding on

At the speed of love
A radiance that travels
At the speed of love
My heart goes out to you

Love is born with solar flares
From two magnetic poles
Moves towards a higher plane
Where two halves make two wholes

Like a force of nature
Love shines in many forms
One night you are bathed in light
One day get carried away in storms

At the speed of love
A radiance that travels
At the speed of love
My heart goes out to you

Than the speed of love
My heart goes out to you

I am the storm
And I am the wonder
And the flashlights, nightmares,
And sudden explosions

I was given just one wish

It’s about you and the Sun
A morning run
The story of my maker
What I have and what I ache for

I’ve got a golden ear
I cut and I spear

What else is there?

Roads are getting nearer
We cover distance still not together

If I am the storm?
If I am the wonder?
Will I have flashlights, nightmares,
And sudden explosion?

You’ve got secrets too

1829,Escape Artist,Sage Francis,"(When I first got in to magic, yeah.)

When I first got into magic, it was an underground phenomenon
Now everybody’s like pick a card, any card
If I shot my full load with the first hand I played
I’d be a monkey in a box hangin’ with the David Blaines
I be swimmin’ with the sharks, mouths full of razor blades
But I’m not, I got out of that game

Escape Artist

I talk ’til I’m red in my face with strain polyps
I’ll rock ’til I’m out of my range then raise octaves
I play through the pain and remain conscience
Refraining from commenting on the lame compliments
And the petty criticisms from those who ain’t accomplished
Even one fifths of some of this shit I made progress with
I’m leaving naysayers stumped like rain forests
After years of pullin’ rabit ears out my pants pockets
I’m not revealin’ any tricks of the trade
It’s just there ain’t no magic in the breakdown baby

In an effort to make ’em all see what I found in my life I decided to give ’em a look
none of ’em gave it a glimpse and I guess that I’m sitting in the middle of an unread book
letters are falling apart
but the sentences descend on their own and the wording is permanent
never been missed
I’ve just been mis-
worded and mis-
interpreted, it’s
funny how serving a sentence of solitary confinement
results in the death sentences filling my running assignment
I’m just wondering where my time went, it pulled a disappearing act
and every single assistant I ever had got sawed in half

You See I never payed attention
But I can’t afford to laugh
’cause I’m lookin’ for my break in an autograph for my CAST
but I’m short on staff so all I ask is volunteers in the crowd
show a little bit of audience participation now

When I say hip (what do I say?)
You, you say shut the fuck up we ain’t sayin shit!
And I’ll respect it
Check it,
In a flair for the dramatic exit
A fashionable entrance
Late to my own arraignment (Oh!)
The self-destructive things that I do for entertainment
My folks gave me this already broken heart as my pallet
While I was out honing my craft you was disowning your talent
That’s why you still live at home
And I bought this house off my parents
I’m getting ahead of myself
(gettin ahead of myself)
I see the hair on my back
(see the hair on my back)
I’m on the road reading Kerouac
It’s poems versus better raps
I think to myself
What’s worth remembering
Versus defending the size of my manhood or confessional canned goods

In an effort to make ’em all see what I found in my life I decided to give ’em a look
none of ’em gave it a glimpse and I guess that I’m sitting in the middle of an unread book
letters are falling apart
but the sentences descend on their own and the wording is permanent
never been missed
I’ve just been mis-
worded and mis-
interpreted, it’s
funny how serving a sentence of solitary confinement
results in the death sentences filling my running assignment
but none of this is getting told in confidence
I spin confidential records just to hold the listeners attention

I’m a veteran of spacial relationships
I clip ya wings to fit you in head shrinking magician
Shape-shifting reptilian turned body contortionist
Orphanages started offering torches to abortion clinics
I lost acquaintances
And a morgue of lady friends
I gender bent the heaven sent angelic devil boy with God’s androgynous
I’m lookin’ marvelous but looks can kill
And I’m unsure about my sexual orientations still
Put me in a special kind of case that only breaks if
You hit it with a bouquet of flowers and baby breath arrangement
The vault is vacant
They’re all looking for fault or blame
I called my agent
The moment that I caught the train
I let him know, I’m going nowhere, he’s invited
If he leaves tonight then he just might help me find it
But this is my burden to bare, not his
And I’m a psychic without a sidekick
Holding the future hostage
A loose cannon standing on the roof top with
A new respect and understanding of bartenders and locksmiths
They call me daredevil but I’m not precise enough
Unprofessional on an amateur level, I love my life too much

1830,Hell Of A Year,Sage Francis,"It’s been a hell of a year, but I’m mentally prepared
To do a dance around the next couple medical scares
I’m Fred Astaire with the metal wearing quickly off my tap shoes
So I step quietly, the way that cat’s move
But I’m bear-like. My head trapped in dear lights
You can call me John, I’m writing letters to the dark side of the moon tonight
My lovely Jane, you went away but the pain stayed
So I’m sending you a package to the address where you traded names
I made no claims on the identity theft
I’m more concerned about the home with no amenities left
And it’s already a mess. The dust piles like your junk mail
So I eat away depression and crush the scale
You find yourself on the opposite side of the spectrum
Emaciated on a strict diet of bed crumbs
Me? I choose to wallow and I’ll just swim in my fat
You… refuse to swallow so I see ribs from the back
This isn’t an attack, it’s an admission of guilt
I’m living in the past, kissing your ass, sipping your milk
But it’s all bone and curdle. I saw stones in a circle
Stood in the middle. Told myself riddles in a robe that’s purple
The murder weapon was an icicle
Is that the reason why I’m standing in this puddle with my eyes so full?
I fight feelings like a war on drugs
I’m a chemist with a test tube addiction born through coffee mugs
Our baby now is all growed up
Your car is still dead in my driveway while I wait for the tow truck
And you know what? I know I drove you away
I still don’t think it was wrong so I don’t know what to say
It’s been a tough year. You say that life ain’t fair
Well, guess what, baby… life ain’t. Thems the breaks
You say that life ain’t worth it. But it is. You gotta work it
Nobody’s life is perfect

Yeah, you’ve been dealt a bad hand. Placed against a stacked deck
Been through all the cat scans and bad checks
But I slashed your debt. Not your wrists
And I couldn’t help with anything else that became cancerous
Halfway people with a full baby to bury
Took a flame to the papier-mache sanctuary
When the smoke clears… try not to stare into the light
But, also, don’t stay in the dark as if that’s what life is like
It’s just a series of unfortunate events
But the messages we get are more important than death
What’s the rush?
I’ve got a shortness of breath
What’s the rush?
Running from you… running from me
It’s the rush. The crush. The lust. The love-trust
So what’s the trouble? The busted bubble? The unjust?
That’s just the way the cookie crumbles. It does suck
But suck it up. We’re all looking, but nothing’s enough
We used each other as a crutch. The clutch. The shift switches
You couldn’t just adjust. You combusted and ripped pictures
This is why I’m not considered a saint?
Well, guess what? … I ain’t

It’s been a hell of a year
You said that I ain’t there, I ain’t care, and life ain’t fair
It’s been a hell of a trip
You say my mind’s unfit, I’ve been flip, and I ain’t shit
It’s been a hell of a life
You say that I ain’t like the way I write and that ain’t right
It’s been a hell of an attempt
You say that I ain’t meant for promises unkept
Well, guess what, darlin…
I’m a keep keep callin
Guess what, darlin…

1831,Too Late to Live Long,SamHaiNe presents,"The key slid into the lock.
With jagged teeth complimenting pins, turning obstructions into openings.
He’d made it.
Stale air, humid smells, gnats in the kitchen.
He’s yawning in the living room, throwing his clothes into the corner with no time, no time at all, none to waste, none to lose.
Thunderstorms and more closing in. But, there’s no more, no distractions, no time.
Gotta move, gotta focus.

The handcuff marks around his wrists are itching.

He ignores the late notice on his ""Welcome"" mat.
He grabs a backpack and empties what he needs from the dresser: ready to eat meals, ramen, the necessities.
The setup on his work desk is too impractical to travel. He’ll leave that for last.

Broadcasting on one of his monitors is police dispatch:
""Suspect escaped. White male, 5'10"", dark hair. Last seen on Oak and Spruce"".

Looks like Frank lost them back at the train station.
Gives him some extra breathing time.

He sees a rat eating the sandwich he left on the TV table.
""Fucking rats -- you let one live and they’ll ruin everything.""

He takes a hammer and slams the rodent’s head with a crunching sound like crackers in a napkin.

He sits down and looks over his monitors and closes some accounts and transfers some Bitcoin into a proxy he had reserved in case of emergencies.

Frank had been pinched earlier downtown by Oak trying to trade some vials of melanin for a few film reels of sketchy interactions between certain persons of influence and faces of media during one of those ""fundraising parties at Bilderberg"".

The client was superstitious and paranoid so, they met in person with analog material in hand.
Sounded just fine to Franco. Physical contraband had more value in its fragility. No fuss, no counterfeit, no malware, no bugs, no viruses.
Frank’s work was commerce and customer service. Illicit materials bought, traded, sold like baseball cards.
When he wasn’t some deep web ""Crazy Eddie"", he’d mine Bitcoin from a warehouse under a phony name.

The client delivered and as soon as he could touch the envelope, Frank was surrounded by ten guns and nine badges.

Should’ve never left the ’Ville. Spooks were probably on the hunt for the film or maybe his hustle; but they couldn’t raid the ’Ville.
Regardless of that, the common denominator was this rat-faced fuck who set him up.

So the screws roughed him up and Frank called them every which thing but Lucy: ""Motherfuckers, Pig Cunts, Shit Micks, Freckled-Kiks, Spic-Fuck-Dog-Faced-Niggers"", the whole lexicon of insults he could sweat between his teeth.

They tossed him into the paddy wagon, cuffed from behind and slammed the door. And he slid around into both sides of the van with every wild and on-purpose turn on the highway.

Fortunately, Frank kept a handcuff key tucked up in his gums and got loose.
Then he slipped out whatever needed hidden in his sneaker soles and popped the backdoor open, jumping from a vehicle going 65mph and making a break for it.

Frank woke up the girl who was still passed out on his bed.
""Get your shit in bag and split"", he said. Pushing her out the door and tossing her things into the stairwell.

She calls him a, ""piece of shit, dickless, computer nerd who can’t fuck anyways"".

Frank gets his go-bag and waits for the bitch to leave the premises. Hoping - no one paid attention to some cracked out whore in the building.

Nothing. Good.

Frank showers after destroying all his files, CDs, hardware, and burning everything analog and paperwork in the apartment. Cold shower calmed him.
He sits on the sofa with his bag on his lap and listens to the rain.
""Don’t rest, gotta go. Stay on point. Focused. Get on your feet. Maybe a few seconds. Clock’s ticking, running out. No more sand, wind and rain. Stay focused. Breathe. No time.""
Franky nods out.

When he opens his eyes an hour has past. Still alive. Still free. A little relaxed, rested.
He slings the strap of his bag over his shoulders and…

Frank staggers to his feet. Stays quiet. He’ll fake ’em out.
They’ll take the bait and move on.
The adrenaline roaring through his body and ringing in his ears.
He’s hoping they’ll see the fake name on the entrance and think twice then move on.
He stays quiet but they keep knocking.
Then he hears another voice, ""Frank! Frank open up the door!""
""Yea, he’s still in there. Frank Welling, that piece of shit.""

Frank shakes his head.
It’s the fucking whore he short changed an hour earlier.
She somehow found the cops; heard the broadcast.
Either way, she brought the pigs to his fucking door.
""Fucking rats -- you let one go and they’ll ruin your life.""

As it rose to resemble you and I
Days later, the moon shone upon your lies
So now I say, I say, I say

""Don't you know that I am exactly what you wanted?
And still am what you want, and what you need
But you seem to have forgotten, the promises you promised
Where you do not forget about me""

Hurry, hurry, hurry like I
Scurry, scurry, scurry away
Hurry, hurry, hurry before
I get carried away

Hurry, hurry, hurry like I
Scurry, scurry, scurried away
Hurry, hurry, hurry like I
Got carried away

Well, don't you know that I am exactly what you wanted?
And still am what you want, and what you need
But you seem to have forgotten, the promises you promised
Where you do not forget about me

1839,Goodnight,Seahaven,"Goodnight my love, my lovely love
God damn shame to be a traitor
I've got God in a shoebox under
My bed waiting for my finger

We both look better in the dark
So I'll do it while we're sleeping
That way I will not reflect
My father's defining features

The absence of consciousness
Welcomes the presence of
Formulated manipulation, no
And I won't feel a thing if you do not

Feel what I feel and you'll find faith to believe in
God I need you, because I'm familiar with the devil
And I've been waiting for the sun to come to dry up all this rain
But I'm caught out in the storm

It's three a.m., I've got you good
I've got you right where I want you
And it must be easy to hold your tongue now
With help from a forty-five

""Next exit, one mile"", it read
But you're moving a mile a minute
That gives you around sixty seconds
Before you reach your destination

So where, oh where, where will you go?
And I won't feel a thing if you don't, you don't, no
So where, oh where, where will you go?
Oh, I won't feel a thing if you do not

Feel what I feel and you'll find faith to believe in
God I need you, because I'm familiar with the devil
And I've been waiting for the sun to come to dry up all this rain
But I'm caught out in the storm

Your safety came with distance
But you foolishly fell into consistency
Place your hand where it does not belong
And I'll be a reminder of your size

Your steady way mirrors the end
The vibrance that fills the pillow behind the head
The one you chose to live within
The one that said, that one that says

Feel what I feel and you'll find faith to believe in
God I need you, because I'm familiar, familiar oh
(With the devil, with the devil, with the devil, with the devil)
And I've been waiting for the sun to come to dry up all this rain
(With the devil)
And I'm still waiting

1840,It's Over,Seahaven,"Well, it rained today inside of me
Winds of dismay, they blew me away
And I felt the change in the weather
It be my blame to place, well, it's over, it's over now

Don't tell me, don't tell me this is for good
And the leaves will never change
I'm waiting, still waiting for your face
To exceed a picture frame
It's four years and a work week to regret
And blame you all over again
And the rest of my life to sleep
And dream of what it could have been

Broken is more now than broken ever was then
Something with some form of fix has gone and grown hopeless
So invent the tools to mend years, years, years of negligence
Or the ability to forget because it's over, it's all over now

Don't tell me, don't tell me this is for good
And the leaves will never change
I'm waiting, still waiting for your face
To exceed a picture frame
It's four years and a work week to regret
And blame you all over again
And the rest of my life to sleep
And dream of what it could have been

You would not believe (you would not believe)
The degree of irony (irony)
That could be in a five-letter metaphor
No, you wouldn't believe, oh no

And in a period of time (period of time)
How many consistent increments compiled (increments compiled)
That could be for news that changes your life
No, you wouldn't believe, oh no

Don't tell me, don't tell me this is for good
And the leaves will never change
I'm waiting, still waiting for your face

When you are flying around and around the world,
And I’m lying and lonely.
I know there’s something sacred and free reserved,
And received by me only.

Nobody knows it but you’ve got a secret smile,
And you use it only for me.
Nobody knows it but you’ve got a secret smile…

Nobody knows it, nobody knows it, nobody knows it,
But you’ve got a secret…

Hundreds of faces in sight
Still I was alone

Door after door
And room after empty room

In the longest days and the darkest nights
(I hear a voice that calls me, that calls me)
Down the longest road there’s a presence of light
(I hear a voice that calls me, that calls me)
I hear a voice that calls me
It’s love’s name I call
In the end

(I hear a voice that calls me, that calls me)

I’ve walked in and out of the fire
Between truth and lies
Now how many children watch
While one child cries

I’ll tear down these walls
And watch while their souls are freed
I’ll throw away pride
To drown in this endless sea

In the longest days and the darkest nights

Down the longest road there’s a presence of light

1869,This Big Hush,Shriekback,"Is there a fire in the sky
Is there a moon up there
Is anything alive now
This darkness is what I hear

This is a breathless silence
A moment out of time
I see your face in the shadows
The tell-tale signs are in your eyes

More than I can hold in my hand
Running through the gaps like water
Aching with a passion inside
Deep as the river

All desire
The ashes and the fire
Turning this night inside
And the light from you

Is there a flame in the dark
Is there a bright heart star
These creatures look the same now
We freeze wherever we are

We wake alone in the blackness
We sleep whenever we fall
One dream all around us
This big hush infects us all

Holding up an animal fear
Soaking up the waves underwater
Tuned to music no one can hear
Forever in this half-light

All desire
The ashes and the fire
Turning this night inside
And the light from you

All desire
The ashes and the fire
Turning this night inside
And the light from you

1870,The Sound of Silence,Simon & Garfunkel,"Hello, darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a streetlamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never shared
And no one dared
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools,"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell

Listen to the sound
Listen to the sound and echoed
Listen to the sound and echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls
And whispered in the sounds of silence""

Lying dormant in a home

Homeless, in disgrace

With every terrible piece or maybe nothing at all

Fortune never favors the old
Tired of defending myself
Go complain to somebody else

In between the poisons and the pure
Contagions and the cure

Who could ask for a better disciple

1916,Snuff,Slipknot,"Bury all your secrets in my skin
Come away with innocence, and leave me with my sins
The air around me still feels like a cage
And love is just a camouflage, for what resembles rage again

So if you love me let me go
And run away before I know
My heart is just too dark to care
I can’t destroy what isn’t there

Deliver me unto my fate
If I’m alone I cannot hate
I don’t deserve to have you
Ooh my smile was taken long ago, if I can change I hope I never know

I still press your letters to my lips
And cherish them in parts of me, that savor every kiss
I couldn’t face a life without your light (without your light)
But all of that was ripped apart, when you refused to fight

So save your breath I will not hear
I think I made it very clear
You couldn’t hate enough to love
Is that supposed to be enough

I only wish you weren’t my friend
Then I could hurt you in the end
I never claimed to be a saint
Ooh my own was banished long ago, it took the death of hope to let you go

Oh oh

So break yourself against my stones
And spit your pity in my soul
You never needed any help
You sold me out to save yourself

And I won’t listen to your shame
You ran away you’re all the same
Angels lie to keep control
Ooh my love was punished long ago, if you still care don’t ever let me know

If you still care don’t ever let me know

Always sell me short, always feel the same
And my face and my soul
Always wear me thin, always under control

Are the ones you sit through to know if you’re right
So I’ll wait, but I’ll pray that I’m wrong
Because I think I know what’s going on!

So let me get this straight: The only will is my own?
I do whatever I want and stay alone?
All my decisions make it untouchable and tainted
I’m gonna suffer for the rest of my life
But I will always find a way to survive
I’m not a failure, but I know what it’s like
I can take it or leave it, or die!

Stay, you don’t always know where you stand, till you know that you won’t run away
There’s something inside me that feels like breathing in sulfur
Like breathing in sulfur!

My life is undone and I’m a sinner to most but a sage to some
And my gods are untrue, I’m probably wrong, but I’m better than you
And the longest hours I’ve had in my life, were the ones I went through to know I was right
So I’m safe, but I’m a little outside
I’m gonna laugh when I’m buried alive!

Stay, you don’t always know where you stand, till you know that you won’t run away
There’s something inside me that feels like breathing in sulfur

1932,Superstar,Sonic Youth,"Long ago
And oh so far away
I fell in love with you
Before the second show
Your guitar
It sounds so sweet and clear
But you’re not really there
It’s just the radio

Don’t you remember you told me you love me baby
You said you’d be coming back this way again baby
Baby baby baby baby oh baby
I love you, I really do

Loneliness, is such a sad affair
And I can hardly wait
To be with you again
What to say
To make you come again
Come back to me again
And play your sad guitar

Don’t you remember you told me you love me baby
You said you’d be coming back this way again baby

1933,Karen Revisited,Sonic Youth,"Heard your name the other day, it’s been a long, long time
Ancient history, some would say, another state of mind
You smell of memory felt-tipped electric child

She takes a plastic pill, she plays the weatherman
She screams ""Religion kills more than it saves you, man""
She painted filigrees, she was the acid queen
She claims society is just a fever dream

Now you live in the trees and salty seas tripping out in the blue skies
You shut the door on everything too busy getting high
And me, just another dream theory lost inside your eyes

She’s not in your history books, lost her mind and kept her looks
Down beneath the radar screen, she’s lit up like gasoline
Been throught a million kicks looking for the one that sticks
Never would’ve known it then, I might not see her again

Top hats and tails for thrills, red lips and famous hands
Sidelong and glancing still in tiny dancer land

We kissed, time slipped, hard edged, tight lipped
See you some time, ask me if I care
Karen, miss communication, Karen, Karen

It’s for alarm, girl, nothing to see
Hear the sirens come for me

You dosed my soul with gasoline
You flicked a match into my brain

Incinerate, incinerate
Incinerate, incinerate

The firefighters are so nice
I remember you so cold as ice
Now flames are licking at your feet
Sirens come to put me out of misery

You wave your torch into my eyes
Flamethrower lover, burning mind

1935,Schizophrenia,Sonic Youth,"I went away to see an old friend of mine
His sister came over, she was out of her mind
She said Jesus had a twin who knew nothing about sin
She was laughing like crazy at the trouble I’m in
Her light eyes were dancing
She is insane
Her brother says she’s just a bitch with a golden chain
She keeps coming closer, saying ""I can feel it in my bones
Schizophrenia is taking me home""

My future is static
It’s already had it
I could tuck you in
And we can talk about it
I had a dream
And it split the scene

It’s coming back to me

I knew you’d take it back all along say the words I don’t want to feel
In every step and all your work you’ve made

And she brings you only sorrow
All the time you know she’s smilin’
You’ll be on your knees tomorrow, ye

With a handle in your hand
Your black cards can make you money
So you hide them when you’re able
In the land of milk and honey
You must put them on the table, ye

Blazing the night as we go

1946,Kill a Kitten,Stephen Lynch,"When the game of life makes you feel like quitting
It helps a lot if you kill a kitten
Mark my words, ’cuz from where I’m sitting
You can’t go wrong if you kill a kitten

There’s no crime that you’ll be committing
I know the law, you can kill a kitten
And if you need yarn for that scarf you’re knitting
You get plenty when you kill a kitten

Feed it turpentine
Or break its spine
Crush him with your shoe
As long as you kill a kitten

If the one you love isn’t quite as smitten
She’ll like you better when you kill a kitten
And I quote the bible, ’cuz that’s where it’s written,
“If thee loving Jesus he must kill a kitten”

Flush him down the can
Hit him with your fan
Drown him in a lake
Bake a kitty cake
Throw him at a train
Make him snort cocaine
Stick some TNT
Up his cat booty
Do what you must do
As long as you kill a kitten

Killing kittens isn’t easy
And if the thought makes you feel queasy
Grab a pitchfork from the shed
And kill a puppy dog instead

Kill a kitten
You gotta kill a kitten
A little furry kitten
A little furry kitten

Kill a kitten
Kill a kitten
You gotta kill a kitten
You gotta kill a ki-i-i-i-i-whoa-oh-oh

We don’t need them, it’s forever us against them all
Forever us against them all

You’ve ever been through
Every battle you fight goes uphill
But nothing can ever break your iron will

Through the streets, into work and school, then back home""

To face a raising fist that screams, ""You think I like this bitch?!""
Don’t you worry my darling, mommy just tripped
She can feel her sanity starting to slip
So she dreams, if I could just go…

Beyond the sun
Where I can’t feel pain
Where I could just fade away
Beyond the sun, where no one lives but me
Help me

Entangled in a web of complete misery
Her cries are stifled by a fear of what he might do to the kids
""If i just stick it out this might end soon""
""This is all my fault,
If I had just done what he said I could have avoided this all""
And still she dreams, if I could just go…

Beyond the sun
Where I can’t feel pain
Where I could just fade away
Beyond the sun, where no one lives but me

And her heart, broken and trapped in a steel cage.
She can’t catch her breath as she chokes on the pain
So she brings her pain to the surface of her skin.

Your frozen agony burns you. Can’t even begin to know
The nightmare that you’ve been through.
Only you can break the cycle that plagues you
There is a light you just have to see it through.

1968,Where The Sun Never Sleeps,Stick To Your Guns,"I live in the valley by the sea
Lined with the scent of orange trees.
This is the place that’s always loved me.
I wake where the sun never sleeps,
In-between the mountains and where the water and sky meet.

This is the place I was raised,
My family and my friends.
This is my everything.
This is the place I was saved,
My beginning and end,
I wouldn’t trade it for anything.

And Just because I leave you doesn’t mean you leave my mind.
I think about you all the time.
This is my solid ground, this sun isn’t going down, down, never going down.
And I have seen a lot of amazing things,
But there’s no feeling like coming home brings.
Now nothing can bring me down, down, down, never bring me down.

Just look at the view,
If this is wrong then I don’t wanna be true.
If you’re not here then I don’t wanna be you.
Even if I tried I couldn’t forget,
It only makes sense that my heart belongs where the sun sets.
And when I start to smell the salt from the sea,
I know I’m close,
I’m coming home.

And Just because I leave you doesn’t mean you leave my mind.
I think about you all the time.
This is my solid ground, this sun isn’t going down, down, never going down.
And I have seen a lot of amazing things,
But there’s no feeling like coming home brings.
Now nothing can bring me down, down, down, never bring me down.

Orange County, this one’s for you!

And Just because I leave you doesn’t mean you leave my mind.

This is our nation without a roof.

The fury of misfortune strikes.
Supreme isolation reigns -
The wolves are at the door we walk on common ground.
Its in our hearts to help those that have been shut out.
And if just one, we are all the tired and the poor.
So lift your lamp before we break down the door.
New colossus,
They fall on blind eyes and your teeming shores, they multiply. naked as the birth of a New day amazing grace please show your sick and hungry a new fate.

Maybe it’s time I saw the world.

I’m only here for a while.
And patience is not my style,
And I’m so tired that I got to go.

What am I supposed to hide now?
What am I supposed to do?
Did you really think I wouldn’t see this through?

Tell me I should stick around for you.
Tell me I can have it all.
I’m still too tired to care and I got to go.

I get to go home in one week.
But I’m leaving home in three weeks.
They throw me a bone just to pick me dry.

I’m following suit and directions.
I crawl up inside for protection.
I’m told what to do and I don’t know why.

I’m over existing in limbo.
I’m over the myths and placebos.
I don’t really mind if I just fade away.

I’m ready to live with my family.
I’m ready to die in obscurity
’Cause I’m so tired that I got to go.

Where am I supposed to hide now?
What am I supposed to do?
You still don’t think I’m gonna see this through?

Tell me I’m a part of history.
Tell me I can have it all.

1985,Absolute Zero,Stone Sour,"The bloody angle, the symmetry
Your cheap adhesive isn’t holding me
My mouth is a gun I can shoot
I can show you the truth
And I don’t need a reason to lie to you

No pun intended, no punishment
If I offended you, you needed it
Ideas are the bombs in your mind, a fissure in time
If you don’t have a weapon, you can’t have mine

I can bleed if I want to bleed
I can fail if I feel the need
This face is my last confession
This life, it feels like a prison

Oh, I’m not afraid
I’m giving into grievances again
You’re looking at an absolute zero
I’m not the Devil, but I won’t be your hero

The catatonic, the sacrilege
Your primadonnas are a privilege
My god has a need to react, it’s as simple as that
It’s better just to settle than face the facts

I can bleed if I want to bleed
I can fail if I feel the need
This face is my last confession
This life, it feels like a prison

Oh, I’m not afraid
I’m giving into grievances again
You’re looking at an absolute zero
I’m not the Devil, but I won’t be your hero

One thing that I can’t stand is when the minutes fight the second hand
I’ll waste a lifetime’s worth just to cling to one more day

No fucking quarter, no premiums
The world is stuck in delirium
""Man"" is a four-letter word, it’s really absurd
The hate isn’t fake, it’s just inferred

Oh, I’m not afraid
I’m giving into grievances again
I’m down to absolute zero
Another zealot with the weight of the fucking world
Oh, I’m not afraid
And I will let you down as I hold you in
You’re looking at an absolute zero
I’m not the Devil, but I won’t be your hero

For this I gave up trying, one good turn deserves my dying

He sits and waits for something better

He hears the bitter laughter
And all he wants to know is

Why does any of it matter?
I can’t take it anymore
You’ve got to try
The inhale that makes the exhale
So much better

He wipes his hands on anything in reach
He never feels clean
He shakes at night because his nerve is gone
Every muscle hurts

Who said it was easy to put back all these pieces?
Who said it was so easy to put back all of these pieces?

Completely misread I’m better off dead.
And now I can see, how fake you can be
This hypocrisy’s beginning to get to me.

Over my head, better off dead.

Can’t find a good reason

You can’t change the state of the nation
We just need some motivation
These eyes have seen no conviction
Just lies and more contradiction
So tell me, what would you say
I’d say its time too late

So am I still waiting
For this world to stop hating
Can’t find a good reason
Can’t find hope to believe in

Ignorance and understanding
We’re the first ones to jump in line
Out of step for what we believe in
But who’s left to stop the bleeding
How far will we take this
It’s not hard to see through the fakeness
So tell me, what would you say
I’d say its time too late

For this world to stop hating
Can’t find a good reason
Can’t find hope to believe

Time won’t make things better
I feel so alone
Can’t help myself
And no one knows
If this is worthless
Tell me

What have we done
We’re in a war that can’t be won
This can’t be real

Surrounds herself in
Whispered hearts and minds

Once dressed in guilty tapestries
And dresses

Option of being buddist or christian?
Did you wanna go praise him
Or was that granny’s decision?

On blessings on blessings on blessings

It won't matter to no one
If you in the ground

How stupid it was, to slow down
If he listened he'd still be around
I could've spoke up and told you

Your sister gone ask herself why
Ain't you gone talk to her
Said you be there forever
Forsake her man
Why did you lie

And your ass finna die

I was dropping my jaw
It was hurting my heart
But I wasn't surprised

They hate you, just look
You can see in their eyes
They want what you got
And they just want to use you

Look past to the skies

How niggas be switching
And singing remind me
Of Mary J. Blige
I should've told you at this point
Before but right now but I come
Humbly taking the time
To tell you I'm sorry
That I let you down with my silence
Because now I be feeling the heat
And thank you for telling me
No one had asked
I thought cause you knew that
It could've been me
Back then someone told me ay
Don't ride with the homie ay

Is the name of the game
The bottom line is money
Nobody gives a fuck!
Four thousand hungry children leave us per hour from starvation
While billions are spent on bombs
Creating death showers

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!
Every time you drop the bomb
You kill the god your child has borne
Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!

Why must we kill our own kind?

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!
Every time you drop the bomb
You kill the god your child has born

Please tell me I am not undone

I've been searching for an exit but I'm lost inside my head
Where I spend every waking moment, wishing I was dead
I'll take another step for you
I'll shed my tears until I drown, or until I am underground
I'll take another breath for you…
Will you still be there when I'm home, out from the great unknown?

It's like there's cancer in my blood
It's like there's water in my lungs
And I can't take another step
Please tell me I am not undone
It's like there's fire in my skin
And I'm drowning from within
I can't take another breath
Please tell me I am not undone

2063,The Weigh Down,The Amity Affliction,"Weigh down
Weigh down on the way down

I've lived behind a mask
So long so few know who I am
They know other sides of me
That hide behind a haunted man

Though my hands are made of stone
And I break everything I see
They save me from myself
And they stand by me

Weighed down on the way down
I need someone to take my hand
It feels like I can't breathe
And I might drown on the way down
I'm sick of all the come downs
Don't tell me that there's nothing wrong
I'm weighed down, weighed down

I'll fight fatigue, I'll fight for you
For everything that we've been through
I'll take your hand, I'll carry on
I've been weighed down for far too long

Though my hands are made of stone
And I break everything I see
They save me from myself
And they stand by me, stand by me

Weighed down on the way down
I need someone to take my hand
It feels like I can't breathe
And I might drown on the way down
I'm sick of all the come downs
Don't tell me that there's nothing wrong
I'm weighed down, weighed down

I won't be weighed down
There's too much resting on this
Never be weighed down
I'll fucking stand here instead

Weigh down on the way down
I need someone to take my hand
It feels like I can't breathe
And I might drown on the way down
I'm sick of all the come downs
Don't tell me that there's nothing wrong

I weigh down on the way down

And the vultures dive to intercept
And the friendship rolls onto its side

They say the language is dead, well, then why do we speak
I hope you understand that my brain is fixed.

Into the next town
This is only a revolt.

Enough is enough because we cannot be late
Basically, you've been defined as ""unworthy of love""
And I confess, I had placed in my heart the same address but I paint with my words
""You're free, don't fear, this is just a revolt"".

Into the next town
This is only a revolt.

Calm rose: violent wind
The only ""surrender"" tonight, shall not be our own
They cannot escape, one if by land, two if by sea
Because I saved my money, but it can't save me
And maybe there is blood from the past, but that is not from me
They can take away one man, and they can take away his might
But they cannot take us all
No, they can't dig a hole the right size to fit all of our dreams
They can't bury me, they can't bury me
We can't hope that somebody else take our place
No, we can't hope that somebody else take our place.

May the history book read of all of our names
Be it blood, be it ink, but at least we were free
This is only but a fraction of what I've got to say
It must be said, it must be said
If I leave this earth tonight may it be said that I spoke my peace
I spoke with the wrath of his grace
Calm rose: come violent wind
Oh we stand hand in hand and we walk without fear
This is a revolution!

We will teach our twisted speech
To the young believers
We will train our blue-eyed men
To be young believers

Can be working for the clampdown

Kick over the wall ’cause government’s to fall
How can you refuse it?
Let fury have the hour, anger can be power
Do you know that you can use it?

Stop wasting your time, there’s nothing coming
Only a fool would think someone could save you

The men at the factory are old and cunning
You don’t owe nothing, so boy, get running
It’s the best years of your life they want to steal

You grow up and you calm down
And you’re working for the clampdown
You start wearing the blue and brown
And you’re working for the clampdown

So you got someone to boss around

You drift until you brutalize
You made your first kill now

Working for the clampdown
But lately one or two has fully paid their due
For working for the clampdown

Creeps closer now
Closer to the foot of the bed
And softer than shadow
And quicker than flies

Don't struggle like that or I will only love you more
For it's much too late to get away or turn on the light

Transform what you once were

In your limbs the fire burns, burns, burns

But no way you’ll win, no matter how you try
Against powers older than life
You’ll get nowhere but back
With your one-dimensional superhero attitude

You are strong, strong, strong

A captain with no ship is just a castaway.

A crown atop your head does not make you a king.
A crowd that follows does not mean you can lead.
Take this for what it is. We all know who’s to blame.
You’re not going to find your place.

My youth is getting older. It got left out in the bitter cold.
Now I put it on the back burner where it doesn’t belong.
Where did I go wrong?

Let me stop to ask the question, “Will I ever get the chance to repeat?”
I feel this more and more everyday. Take me back to when I used to believe.

Nothing could prepare you, but we try our best.
Failure upon failure, what happens next?
Nothing’s ever easy and life still goes on.
Don’t stop push on before you become withdrawn. I’ve become withdrawn.

My youth is getting older. It got left out in the bitter cold.
Now I put it on the back burner where it doesn’t belong.

My innocence is gone. Where did I go wrong?
I feel it slipping away from me. Do you remember when we were free?

I’ve stood up on that ledge, and I know what you see:
You’re looking over the edge and wanting to leap.
I’ve written every word and expressed all my concerns.
You’re losing that part of yourself, but it wasn’t meant to be.

No chance to be free. No chance to soar in the sky.
Your feet fixed to the ground.
Desperation is what’s weighing you down.
Whether my strength be heaven sent or my own self-confidence.

Tonight you got to test the limits and tell yourself that.
“I’m alive!” Just make that choice and draw that line tonight.
Tonight you got to test the limits and tell yourself that,

“Be a leader and never ever follow”
That’s what my father, that’s what he always told me.

From under our feet
Leaving our skin
And burning coals to meet

2131,Violets Are Blue,The Killing Tree,"Somehow I knew that this would end
and then I finally found my way back home.
And this is all one master plan
to keep us spinning down this endless well
I’m drowning in my own regrets
I’m trying so hard to take what’s my last breath.
This is all I wanted from you.
So alone and now I’ll have you know

If you can stand on your own two feet
then you can get up off your fucking knees.
Stand up and wash
away the blood
that stains your soul.
You’ve given me reason
to tear you apart.
Now you can’t fix whats already broke

Now I’ll have you know.

Don’t surrender,
never give up your fucking life.
you lied
about
your pride in self.
I pushed from inside your skin
I eat you away from within
You’ll never see the sun again

I’ll have you know
look away
from this broken mirror
now the time has come to
slow the beating of this heart.

Better late then never I always say

Still dream in colors they’ve not yet seen
And scrawl their thoughts
On pens that ran out of ink

I tried to hold you close to me
But my claws are too sharp

I’ve seen that dead look before
Too paralyzed to move
Don’t try to hold me back

The same thing that keeps me alive
is the same one I’ll gladly bite

Remembering tears of not so long ago

Where are the dreams we dreamt up
And all the things we wanted
And the time that we lost
To pull it back together

All the nights that I waited
For you to come home
And when you’d do we’d cuss and fuss
It ain’t that I don’t love you
It’s cuz it’s too much
And I couldn’t tell you enough

And a pride that’s tearin’ us apart

The shadow pooling underneath me
As it follows on the ground

Stared deep into your eyes
I meant to say ""I love you""

Every day, well it’s the same
That bong that’s on the table starts to call my name
I take a hit and zone out again
I’ll be paranoid and hungry by a quarter to ten
Watching reruns on my TV
I’m laughing off my ass at three’s company
I don’t now if I’m understood
but hearing Jimmy Buffett never sounded so good

Your memory’s gone and so is your life (your life)
Mota boy
But losing out just never felt so right
Your enemy’s you and so is your life (your life)
Mota boy
But losing out might feel okay all night
Mota

I’m driving down to the Barrio
Going 15 miles an hour cause I’m already stoned
Give the guy a twenty and wait in the car
He tosses me a baggie then he runs real far
I take a hit but it smells like a clove
Oh FUCK I got a baggie of oregano
This ritual is destroying me
But I guess it could be worse
It could be methedrine

Your memory’s gone and so is your life (your life)
Mota boy
But losing out just never felt so right
Your enemy’s you and your couch is your life (your life)

Trying to get where I’d like to stay

By someone trying to tell me
What to say and do

I don’t want it
I gotta go find my own way
I gotta go make my own mistakes
Sorry man for feeling
Feeling the way I do

Oh yeah, oh yeah

By the way
I know your path has been tried and so
It may seem like the way to go
Me, I’d rather be found
Trying something new

And the bottom line
In all of this seems to say
There’s no right and no wrong way
Sorry if I don’t feel like
Living the way you do

Rage and grace
Pulling me closer, pushing away at me
The sharpest thorn on your vine
Twistin’ and turnin’, we’re all intertwined

Broken wing
Empty glass
Words that scream and bounce right back
She says, ""You know, we’d all like to rearrange""

I wish I could fix you
And make you how I want you
I wish I could fix you
And I wish you could fix me
I wish I could heal you
And mend where you are broken
I wish I could heal you
And I wish you could heal me

A beaming sunrise buries the night
The setting sun destroys the light
And she says, ""Baby, I’ve gotta get going""
Cutting each other without even knowing

She sees a million stars like holes in the sky
All god’s tears for her, they cry
And I am in her reign

I wish I could fix you
And make you how I want you
I wish I could fix you
And I wish you could fix me

There’s someone around me just a step behind
It’s kinda scary the shape I’m in
The walls are shaking and they’re closing in

Too fast or a bit too slow
I’m paranoid of people and it’s starting to show
One guy that I can’t shake
Over my shoulder, is a big mistake

Sitting on the bed and I’m lying wide awake
There’s demons in my head and it’s more than I can take
I think I’m on a roll but I think it’s kinda weak
Saying all I know is, I gotta get away from me

I tell you something just ain’t right
My head is on loose but my shoes are tight
Avoiding my friends, they all bug
Life is like a riddle and I’m really stumped

If you reason, don’t you know
Your own preoccupation is where you’ll go
I’m being followed, I look around
It’s only my shadow creeping on the ground

Sitting on the bed and I’m lying wide awake
There’s demons in my head and it’s more than I can take

And practiced all the things I would say
But she came over, I lost my nerve
I took her back and made her dessert

Oh, I know I’m being used
That’s okay, man, ’cause I like the abuse
I know she’s playing with me
That’s okay, ’cause I got no self esteem

Oh way oh, yeah, yeah

Then I wonder why she sleeps with my friends
When she’s saying, oh that I’m like a disease

Well, I guess I should stick up for myself
But I really think it’s better this way
The more you suffer, the more it shows you really care
Right?
Yeah!

Now, I’ll relate this little bit
It happens more than I’d like to admit
Late at night she knocks on my door
She’s drunk again and looking to score

Now, I know I should say no
But it’s kind of hard when she’s ready to go
I may be dumb, but I’m not a dweeb
I’m just a sucker with no self esteem

And every kid on the whole damn street (whoa, oh!)
Was gonna make it big and not be beat

Now the neighborhood’s cracked and torn (whoa, oh!)
The kids are grown up but their lives are worn (whoa, oh!)
How can one little street
Swallow so many lives?

Chances thrown, nothing’s free
Longing for used to be
Still it’s hard, hard to see
Fragile lives, shattered dreams

Jamie had a chance, well she really did (whoa, oh!)
Instead she dropped out and had a couple of kids (whoa, oh!)
Mark still lives at home ’cause he’s got no job (whoa, oh!)
He just plays guitar and smokes a lot of pot

Jay committed suicide (whoa, oh!)
Brandon OD’d and died (whoa, oh!)

I nearly lose my nerve

But she's just somebody else

Sink the track

Clubs like spores react past those visions
And hurrying more
Reflects on the dancefloor
Blowing up
And having mad people showing up
Packing crowds
Jam-packed venues
Needles collapse
While atmospheres continues
Sprinkle that
Winnin’ like that
Movin’ like that
Hittin’ like that

Blows your mind drastically, fantasically

Change to another route

I leave cords of mikes hanging like spring leaves
Do a track so fast, beyond from you and I
Lyrical tactics, vocal gymnastics
E’s and pepped up
You get swept up
Smacked up, backed up
Your crew’s all cracked up

Choose quick
You can’t stick

You get tangled
Twist inside affections

Can’t compete

Cuts like a barbwire

Fast forward

Come a time
Some day, some day, some day

Some say prayers

In the light of the fact
On the lone and level
Sand stretch far away
In the heat of the action
In the settled dust
Hold hold and sway
In the meeting of a mind
Down in the streets of shame
In the betting of names on gold to rust
In the land of the blind
Be king, king, king, king

In the land of the blind
Be king, king, king, king

We serve an old man in a dry season
A lighthouse keeper in the desert sun
Dreamers of sleepers and white treason
We dream of rain and the history of the gun
There’s a lighthouse in the middle of Prussia
A white house in a red square
I’m living in films for the sake of Russia
A kino runner for the DDR
And the fifty-two daughters of the revolution
Turn the gold to chrome
Gift, nothing to lose
Stuck inside of Memphis with the mobile home, sing:

Mother Russia, Mother Russia, Mother Russia rain down, down, down
Mother Russia, Mother Russia, Mother Russia rain down

Mother Russia, Mother Russia, Mother Russia rain down, down, down
Mother Russia, Mother Russia, Mother Russia rain down

Mother Russia, Mother Russia, Mother Russia rain down, down, down

Never never land

Too much but never enough

And our eyes on the ground
With the clouds far below
No horizon around
With the wind in our face
And our arms open wide
We will pass through this place
To the other side

All the ways of our calling

She go walking, she go crawling, she go sliding through the air
She goes talking warm and fashion, she goes talking debonair
But, see her face turns to a mask and passion turns to she don’t care

She will, she will, she will, she will let it take her life away
Let it wrap itself around her ’til it kill her in its way
She will, she will, she will, she will blow away

Baby hit the rush hour traffic, get a ride to anywhere
Baby buy the number three, she pay the man, she pay the fare
Baby hit the wild blue yonder, on the mainline, on the side
Steal to feed the Anaconda, will not see the suicide

She will, she will, she will, she will let it take her life away
Let it wrap itself around her ’til it kill her in its way

Baby finger on the trigger, baby shoot formaldehyde
Turn into a marble figures, turn the matter dead inside
Turn into a China doll, go maybe to the final ride
Baby go where I don’t follow, baby to the other side

2219,The Taste of Ink,The Used,"Is it worth it, can you even hear me?
Standing with your spotlight on me
Not enough to feed the hungry
I’m tired and I’ve felt it for a while now
In this sea of lonely
The taste of ink is getting old
It’s four o’ clock in the fucking morning
Each day gets more and more like the last day
Still I can see it coming
While I’m standing in the river drowning
This could be my chance to break out
This could be my chance to say goodbye
At last it’s finally over
Couldn’t take this town much longer
Being half dead wasn’t what I planned to be
Now I’m ready to be free

So here I am, it’s in my hand
And I’ll savor every moment of this
So here I am, alive at last
And I’ll savor every moment of this

And won’t you think I’m pretty
When I’m standing top the bright lit city
And I’ll take your hand and pick you up
And keep you there so you can see
As long as you’re alive and care
I promise I will take you there
We’ll drink and dance the night away, drink and dance the night away

So here I am, it’s in my hand
And I’ll savor every moment of this
So here I am, alive at last
And I’ll savor every moment of this
Savor every moment of this

The promises we made were not enough
The prayers that we had prayed were like a drug
The secrets that we sold were never known
The love we had, the love we had, we had to let it go

Tell me would you kill to save a life?

Between monolithic towers of empty life
Pour me a glass of amnesia

Bleak your teeth of pure stone
Sway your arms of concrete flesh
Search with eyes of thousand souls
Your piped veins in turmoil

I’ll suffer the day just hoping for the best

But that’s not to say I don’t think that all of this can change
But that’s not to say I won’t wake up some day
With a lion’s pride that I’m gonna be okay

If again I’m asked how I’d like to be remembered
Next time I’ll be better prepared for the answer
But you’ll never know much of the truth
So I’ll just exist, it’s all I can do

So much to consider and too much to grasp
To swallow mortality is enough of a task
And leaving your mark is just too much to ask
I’ll just bow my head and leave out the back

2285,Kerosene,Touché Amoré,"It’s the early signs of disintegration
The back and forth from a new machine
It’s been blessed and burned into a formation
By a wish dipped in kerosene

So who’s gonna light the fuse?
Who’s going to be the one
To hold high the flame
Because I refuse

And I’ve just begun
So don’t hold me down, I’m almost done
A lesson lived through the loss of love
This is not a search for who’s at fault
It’s more of a plea for hope and understanding

It’s the side effects of adoration
The come and go and get out clean
I’ve been cursed and freed from dedication
By a wish dipped in kerosene

So who’s gonna light the fuse?
Who’s gonna be the one
Because I refuse

And I’ve just begun
So don’t hold me down, I’m almost done
A lesson lived through the loss of love
This is not a search for who’s at fault
It’s more of a plea for hope and understanding

2286,Non Fiction,Touché Amoré,"Every moment can’t remain
And every life won’t stay the same
With time comes a layer of rust
And our bones will turn to dust
Everyone will fall away
And every season is built on change
With time, the paint will peel
And all sense will lose its feel
Every cloth will start to fray
And every night will become day
With time, a mold will form
And what’s cold can become warm
Every love can’t always stay
And the dead will soon decay
With time, we’ll all be gone
But how you lived can live on

Every moment can’t remain
And every life won’t stay the same
With time comes a layer of rust
And our bones will turn to dust

And every season is built on change

Every cloth will start to fray
And every night will become day

And the dead will soon decay

2287,Social Caterpillar,Touché Amoré,"It’s not for nothing, but I’ve seen a transformation
Like I consider my happiness for the first time in ages
And you might say I’m off, but it’s the first time I’m feeling on

Don’t worry, I still get dizzy in the usual situations

And most people I know, I’ve used as camouflage
I’ve circled myself with pretty people to hide who I was
And I won’t miss them and they won’t miss me

I’ll tie in those loose ends
A string is just the thread to separation
And I’ll retire these old clothes
To brace for a wardrobe that no one knows

Don’t worry, I still get dizzy in the usual situations
But it’s those instances I have used to ground me on occasion
Don’t worry, I still get dizzy in the usual situations


",2
2288,Steps,Touché Amoré,"Over and under
I’ll dissolve and use charm as my cover
Left over right
Walk a careful line between you and the outside

There is confidence and delusion
I reside between that confusion
It’s a misstep down a black hole
It’s a long way down and a mouthful

So overcome and become one
So over…

Over and under
We learn to grow and we learn to recover
Over and out
I’ll play the card that holds me in less doubt

There’s promiscuity and devotion
And only one fulfills an emotion
It’s a big step to end a yearning
It’s accepting love but I’m learning

To overcome and become one
So overcome and become one

I’ll find my way
And follow through
And maybe there
I’ll find my way
And follow through
And maybe there
I’ll find my way
And follow through
And maybe there I’ll meet you

2289,To Write Content,Touché Amoré,"You can call this coming clean
Or the repeat of what you know
About the struggles I once had
As I’m learning to let go

I made a pledge to myself
If I was to raise my voice
To be direct as I can be
No matter what I may destroy
But I can’t say I haven’t aged
I’ve outgrown what I used to be
I won’t fake what is expected
To succeed with album three (That’s not me)

Does this mean that the words won’t come?
Does this mean that I’m at my end?
If my joy comes with the price of my love
I won’t pay if I have to pretend
There’s always a chance to relapse and fall back
To the person I still fear is there
So if this ink will suddenly run out
I’ll refill if I feel the need to share

It was the fall of last year in New York City
Day two of a tour, when my friend Johnny said
“Hey, I’d like you to meet Andy”
We got to talking and connected on some things
Mutual friends and how his band started writing
But then something was spoke
I knew exactly what he meant
I understood when he said
“It’s hard to write content”

And it still is, and it still is
But I won’t take a step back
Though it might be for the best
And it still is, and it still is

I know you asked for some advice
They use your blood to capitalize
So give up all your secrets
To move units, display your weakness
You might spend some years alone
At the price of forgetting your home
So expose what hurts you the worst
The exchange deals a handsome return (Are you in?)


",3
2290,Amends,Touché Amoré,"What have I seen other than what the bottom looks like?
Stuck somewhere between the gloom and the light
When you’re working towards building back those broken boards
You sometimes lose your footing
You often find yourself putting off everyone while finding comfort in other songs
To distract the fact that you’re actually disappearing
I have no excuses that I can offer
Just the hope that your forgiveness will hold back the water
For what its worth…; I’m sorry
And at the end I swear I’m trying.


",1
2291,Art Official,Touché Amoré,"Retracing my steps in hopes to find
Some part of me that may be somewhere left behind
There’s a fear, there’s a point, there is a problem
What if what I find won’t solve any of them
And I wonder why I have no motivation
I guess I just answered my own question
I’m not the golden boy so don’t shine me on
I’m the bastard son of romantic babylon
With veins that are all fashioned out of copper
A past design not destined to be concurred
But like anything there is a flaw inscripted deep
That may explain everything


",4
2292,Condolences,Touché Amoré,"If you fantasize about your funeral, I understand
I’ve been there before
If what’s more important, is the music played
Than who’d attend
We
Are
The
Same
With heads to the ground,
As I’m lowered down,
There will be a chorus
An overwhelming sound.


",3
2293,Crutch,Touché Amoré,"You said I’m always on the go
How nice of you to notice
A toast to all those broken homes
Everyone I know is a fortress
I kiss ellipsis
A fork in all my one way roads
I just sit to see what happens
But apathy is easy for me
So I’ll accept this challenge
I don’t know how to get myself up
Your pressure is bending my crutch
If this thing breaks, it’s the end of us both
But I like the sound of that


",5
2294,Face Ghost,Touché Amoré,"There is weight in the words we’ve said
Too heavy to carry in our heads
There’s a chance that I thought had gone
But here we are, playing along
I admit I’m scared
So fragile, emotionally impaired (hopeless)
Damaged goods
So broken, so misunderstood
(wreckless and careless)
And I can see
That rain cloud that follows me
Looks like the one that follows you
And the same ghosts that keep me awake haunt your nights just the same
All dressed up in black and grey
We know each other just the same
And every mile that sits between
Won’t understand what it means
To have one look mean everything
And throw all caution to the sea
I have faith in us if we don’t self destruct


",1
2295,Method Act,Touché Amoré,"Don’t ask me why
Have you ever wondered why I always drive alone?
Same reasons why I never pick up my phone
I got these issues that you can’t subscribe
And I’m scared to talk to anyone for what they might prescribe

These days I just try to keep to myself
Well aware I’ve lost touch with everyone else
I understand that I’m fading away
I’d rather play dead than play catch up
Because no one really cares all that much
I can’t keep having the same conversations
I look to the floor to keep concentration
Focused hard on every single word
My nails are dug deep and my stomach hurts
I am selfish it seems, but I’m trying my best to breathe
Hoping you don’t notice as I keep laughing


",3
2296,Pathfinder,Touché Amoré,"I feel what’s best for everyone is to forget about me when I’m gone
Because it hurts to be missed and no one is deserving this
With my back to a hardwood floor
I understand that I’m not a provider but a center divider
I got lanes to explain the different ways I behave
A life thats a detour to where I am not sure
But if the sun is in my eyes I think I’m doing the right thing
I rely on exit signs, and destination times
And this drive that knows me better than I think I know myself
With that being said I won’t play pretend
That I’m not growing up, that I’m not giving in
Late nights and all night drives are the reason why I’m alive
And I’m not going anywhere


",5
2297,Sesame,Touché Amoré,"If you’re looking for a place
To hang your head in shame
The light is always on
So come on in
My eyes are too big for my stomach
It can’t process all that I do
A rich diet of endless endeavors
At the expense of me and you
There’s a thousand reasons why I can’t open up
Every combination is one turn off
There’s no rest for the weak
I need a week’s rest desperately


",1
2298,The Great Repetition,Touché Amoré,"With intermission ending, the finale is approaching
It’s not what you’re expecting, there is no magic involved
Now will you take your seats, and be quiet please
I need all eyes on me, as I try to explain:
This is my final act so may I have your full attention
And for my final trick I’ll make everyone who loves me disappear
But I won’t know how to bring them back
Alone I’ll stand on this stage
No one to care, myself to blame
An act with no conclusion
That’s me up there
That’s me: repetition

2299,Excess,Tricky,"I believe in eye-deceivin’
Bob’n’weavin’, I can breathe in
Make a wish in flower fish
Moving vibration, mild relation
I’m jamaican on your radio station
Got a curse in, could be worse in
You first in a hearse in
Good as dead as, nothing left in
Nothing left in, some might heading

From the mess (He and I)
Couldn’t care less (In fact any time, every day)
Sugar cane (Write fictional stories)

But I don’t complain (On the street, in your home)

I believe in different reasons
I believe in breakthrough seasons
I believe when snow flakes fall
I believe in buildings tall

I believe in people bombing
I believe in people warring
I believe diseases coming
I believe that’s why I’m running

Keep living

Before he attacks (Of he and I)
You’ve got the flats (In fact any time)
Dub my sacks (Every day)
You’ve got the city (Writing fictional stories)

2300,Dying In Your Arms,Trivium,"I’m wearing thin, wearing out, becoming weak
Holding hands with this rope
She’s my self-destructive bleeding disease
The things that makes it hard to breathe
But if I shoved you far away
This addict just starved again, asphyxiated

And now I see it’s you that’s tearing me
Ensnaring me
This is me dying in your arms
I cut you out; now set me free

Lynched high above what used to be
In her gallows built for me
So I escaped; cut this noose around my neck

I break free to see the things you blinded me
And I shoved you far away
Now I live the life I dreamed of
You’re dead to me

And now I see it’s you that’s tearing me
Ensnaring me
This is me dying in your arms
I cut you out; now set me free

You poisoned my life
So I take this knife
And I cut you out
Cut you out

And now I see it’s you that’s tearing me
Ensnaring me
This is me dying in your arms
I cut you out; now set me free

Set me free… set me free

2301,Down From The Sky,Trivium,"A chasm grows
In the cavity of serpentine teeth
Hunger pangs strike
For the sweet feast of innocent blood
Of innocent bloodshed
Now here we go

The vampires feed off the wars of mankind
The vampires feed off the wars of mankind

Growing fat on the throne of an empire
Tyrant rules with the threat of a great fire

I’ve opened up my eyes
Seen the world for what it’s worth
Tears rain down from the sky
They’ll blow it all to bits
To prove whose god wields all the power
Blood rains down from the sky

The gaping wounds
Hemorrhaging the blood from which they feast
Eat us alive
Consume to feed a hunger with no
A hunger with no end
Let’s fucking go

The vampires feed off the wars of mankind
The vampires feed off the wars of mankind

Growing fat on the throne of an empire
Tyrant rules with the threat of a great fire

I’ve opened up my eyes
Seen the world for what it’s worth
Tears rain down from the sky
They’ll blow it all to bits
To prove whose god wields all the power
Blood rains down from the sky

This battle’s not the same which they have led us to believe
A synthesis of propaganda, terror and deceit
We are the cattle; they the slaughter; our meat: gasoline

They pump us through the machine’s valves to cleanse the world’s ""disease""
We are the ammunition that will cause all life to cease

Annihilate
All those who stand in their way
Obliterate
They’ll rain their holocaust down from the sky

The vampires feed off the wars of mankind
The vampires feed off the wars of mankind

Growing fat on the throne of an empire
Tyrant rules with the threat of a great fire

Put away, put away
All the gods your father served today
Put away, put away
Your traditions, believe me when I say
We don’t know, we don’t know
How to put back the power in our soul
We don’t know, we don’t know
Where to find what once was in our bones

2311,Lane Boy,Twenty One Pilots,"They say stay in your lane boy, lane boy
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway, highway
But will they be alive tomorrow?

They think this thing is a highway, if it was our way
We’d have a tempo change every other time change
’Cause our mind’s changed on what we think is good
I wasn’t raised in the hood
But I know a thing or two about pain and darkness
If it wasn’t for this music, I don’t know how I would have fought this
Regardless, all these songs I’m hearing are so heartless
Don’t trust a perfect person and don’t trust a song that’s flawless
Honest, there’s a few songs on this record that feel common
I’m in constant confrontation with what I want and what is poppin’
In the industry, it seems to me that singles on the radio are currency
My creativity’s only free when I’m playing shows

They say stay in your lane boy, lane boy
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway, highway
But will they be alive tomorrow?

(They be alive tomorrow?)
I’m sorry if that question I asked last
Scared you a bit like a hazmat in a gas mask
If you ask Zack, he’s my brother, he likes when I rap fast
But let’s backtrack, back to this
Who would you live and die for on that list?
But the problem is, there’s another list that exists
And no one really wants to think about this
Forget sanity, forget salary
Forget vanity, my morality
If you get in between someone I love and me
You’re gonna feel the heat of my cavalry

All these songs I’m hearing are so heartless
Don’t trust a perfect person and don’t trust a song that’s flawless

They say stay in your lane boy, lane boy
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway, highway

They rip it, flip it, but these are just triplets

Who takes every moment he knows he confided in
Music to use it, for others to use it
You’re dead, ’cause how could you sleep at a time like this?

Life is up here but you comment below
And the comments will always become common motivation
To promote your show’s next episode
So your brain knows to keep going even though hope
Is far from this moment, but you and I know it
Gets better when morning finally rears its head
Together we’re losers, remember the future
Remember the morning is when night is dead

’Cause somebody stole

Sometimes quiet is violent
I find it hard to hide it
My pride is no longer inside

It’s on my sleeve

Reminding me
Of who I killed

But from the things that work, there are only two
And from the two that we choose to do
Peace we’ll win, and fear we’ll lose

And there’s faith and there’s sleep
We need to pick one please because
Faith is to be awake
And to be awake is for us to think
And for us to think is to be alive
And I will try with every rhyme
To come across like I am dying
To let you know you need to try to think

I must’ve forgot, you can’t trust me
I’m open a moment and close when you show it
Before you know it I’m lost at sea
And now that I write and think about it
And the story unfolds
You should take my life
You should take my soul

You are surrounding all my surroundings
Sounding down the mountain range
Of my left-side brain
You are surrounding all my surroundings
Twisting the kaleidoscope
Behind both of my eyes

And I’ll be holding on to you
And I’ll be holding on to you

Remember the moment
You know exactly where you’re going
’Cause the next moment, before you know it
Time is slowing and it’s frozen still
And the windowsill looks really nice, right?
You think twice about your life
It probably happens at night, right?

Fight it, take the pain, ignite it
Tie a noose around your mind
Loose enough to breathe fine and tie it
To a tree, tell it, ""You belong to me
This ain’t a noose, this is a leash
And I have news for you, you must obey me""

You are surrounding all my surroundings
Sounding down the mountain range
Of my left-side brain
You are surrounding all my surroundings
Twisting the kaleidoscope
Behind both of my eyes

Entertain my faith
Entertain my faith
Entertain my faith
Entertain my faith

Entertain my faith
Entertain my faith
Entertain my faith
Entertain my faith

Entertain my faith
Entertain my faith

Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat?
Shadows will scream that I’m alone, lone, lone

I-I-I-I’ve got a migraine
And my pain will range from up, down, and sideways
Thank God it’s Friday ’cause Fridays will always
Be better than Sundays ’cause Sundays are my suicide days

I don’t know why they always seem so dismal
Thunderstorms, clouds, snow, and a slight drizzle
Whether it’s the weather or the letters by my bed
Sometimes death seems better than the migraine in my head

Let it be said what the headache represents
It’s me defending in suspense, it’s me suspended in a defenseless test
Being tested by a ruthless examinant
That’s represented best by my depress…;

…;ing thoughts
I do not have writer’s block, my writer just hates the clock
It will not let me sleep, I guess I’ll sleep when I’m dead
And sometimes death seems better than the migraine in my head

Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat?
Shadows will scream that I’m alone
But I know we’ve made it this far, kid

I am not as fine as I seem, pardon
Me for yelling, I’m telling you green, gardens
Are not what’s growing in my psyche, it’s a different me
A difficult beast feasting on burnt down trees

Freeze frame please, let me paint a mental picture portrait
Something you won’t forget, it’s all about my forehead
And how it is a door that holds back contents
That make Pandora’s Box’s contents look nonviolent

Behind my eyelids are islands of violence
My mind’s shipwrecked, this is the only land my mind could
Find, I did not know it was such a violent island
Full of tidal waves, suicidal crazed lions

They’re trying to eat me, blood running down their chin
And I know that I can fight or I can let the lion win
I begin to assemble what weapons I can find
’Cause sometimes to stay alive you got to kill your mind

Am I the only one I know
Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat?
Shadows will scream that I’m alone
But I know we’ve made it this far, kid

And I will say that we should take a day to break away
From all the pain our brain has made
The game is not played alone

And I will say that we should take a moment and hold it
And keep it frozen and know that
Life has a hopeful undertone

And I will say that we should take a day to break away
From all the pain our brain has made
The game is not played alone

And I will say that we should take a moment and hold it
And keep it frozen and know that
Life has a hopeful undertone

To rip my heart apart and start
Planning my crash landing
I go up, up, up, up
Up to the ceiling
Then I feel my soul start leaving
Like an old man’s hair receding

I’m pleading please, oh please
On my knees repeatedly asking
Why it’s got to be like this?
Is this living free?
I don’t want to be the one, be the one
Who has the sun’s blood on my hands, I’ll tell the moon
Take this weapon forged in darkness
Some see a pen, I see a harpoon

Why am I not scared in the morning?

I must’ve kicked them out
I must’ve kicked them out

I swear I heard demons yelling
Those crazy words they were spelling
They told me I was gone
They told me I was gone

But I’ll tell them
Why won’t you let me go?
Do I threaten all your plans?
I’m insignificant
Please tell them
You have no plans for me
I will set my soul on fire
What have I become?

On the eve of a day
That’s forgotten and fake
As the trees, they await
And clouds anticipate
The start of a day
When we put on our face
A mask that portrays
That we don’t need grace

On the eve of a day
That is bigger than us
But we open our eyes
’Cause we’re told that we must
And the trees wave their arms
And the clouds try to plead
Desperately yelling
There’s something we need

I’m not free
I asked forgiveness three times
Same amount that I denied
I three-time mvp’ed this crime
I’m afraid to tell you who I adore
Won’t tell you what I’m sing towards
Metaphorically, I’m a whore
And that’s denial number four

I’ll stay awake

Why am I not scared in the morning?

Someone drops dead whom I adore
You love someone, there will be grief
The kiss of death, lips of a thief

Goddamnit!

A dusty stack of photographs
Of times I cried, but mostly laughed
Commit the past into blue flame
Acrid smoke cowardly shame

Goddamnit!

At times I’m truly terrified
’Cause dope and booze don’t help to hide
They used to mask a weakling’s hurt
It’s just like painting over dirt

Everyone I love is dead
Everyone I love is dead

(All dead)

Life’s a game I cannot win
Both good and bad must surely end
The mirrors always tell the truth
I love myself for hating you

Everyone I love is dead
Everyone I love is dead
Everyone I love is dead
Everyone I love is dead

Goddamnit!

All dead, all dead, all dead, all dead, all dead, all dead, all dead, all dead

When I’ve lost myself

And the sticky hole sucks me in

I feel lifeless
Something drives me
I’m controlled by threads
Connected to my hands and feet

And I will fly
To find myself

But I’m routined
So I stand up
And I change place
Search new ways
But my thoughts go round in circles

Get in contact

When you see me
Piece by piece my life returns

Get an ugly face.

The places I like the most?

I will protect my dreams.

And i pray theyre strong enough to weather gems from cindered coal,

Burned out before the stoke.

And you know that I will fall for it every time,
When we collide it’s death to rights.

How many will we leave wondering?

It starts we never finish and ends we never start,
How many lives will break upon our callous hearts,

Reaching the greatest heights my dreams find,

I await the day the stars won’t seem so far away,
And greet a sun the darkened clouds have kept at bay,
But until then, until then.

My wings they unfold in a storming gale,
The tempest calls for my flight to fail,
When gravity beckons with its hold,
In spite of ’all the horizon sends winds to take me home.

I’ll build my throne from broken bones,
Defeats I’ve known and deeds ive left untold,
My story is the storm.

We bend, we break, we’re forced to heal,
The toll it takes in time revealed.

I choose the shot to usher in deliverance,
Flood away the past I can’t tow,
But like the river weathers stone it shapes and withers my home,
To a place I barely know.

We bend, we break, we’re forced to heal,
The toll it takes in time revealed,
The trial in wake of it creates or tears us down,
We bend, we break, we learn to heal.

So strike away the grip of past mistakes.

Some have all the luck, some just live in dirt
Here are several types of the color of the skin

You feel so alive where the eagles cry
And you feel so strong on a mountain high
But in fact you are at his bottom just
His unattainable top seems to be a must

We will stay down,

Down where we belong

We will stay down,

And the rain keeps knocking on our Mother Earth
And the snow keeps falling, is it really worth
To live through this ache and to die at last
When you’re predestined and the die is cast?

Our thoughts are fading in a time that melts
Our flesh is fading as we’ve always felt
But we kid ourselves to meet heaven’s feast
To rise up to God and to be released

We will stay down,
We will stay down,
We will stay down,
Down where we belong

We will stay down,
We will stay down,
We will stay down,
Down where we belong

You belong to us, to the human crap
Which will never win and succumbs in traps
That are set by others with deceitfulness
And you stumble into them with thankfulness

No one knows if we are to survive the storm
But I tell you man you are just a worm
Just a little error on a hopeless crust
You’re sleazy man and your limbs will rust

We will stay down,
We will stay down,

Plenty of time when you’re dead
To be the perfect girl
There’s plenty of room in your bed
To make a perfect world

Makes you blind, blind
Lies, lies, lies

Out of a fucked up head
Comes a perfect girl
Out of a fucked up head
One perfect world

I want to fall a million floors
I’m gonna breathe through open pores
I’m gonna scream out open doors
God bless the models

Time, time, time
Makes you learn, learn
That love, love, love
You will have to earn

Out of a fucked up head
Comes a perfect word
Out of a fucked up head
Comes a perfect world

I want to fall a million floors
I’m gonna scream through open doors
You’ll make the headlines when you die

Out of a fucked up head
